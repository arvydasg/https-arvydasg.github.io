Some random vim - okay I can not Not share <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c68MkeMBjhE">this</a>. During my long
pomodoro break I found this vim shortcut tutorial. Learned a bunch.
You can use numbers in the commands? Mindblown.

I think I will also install some plugins for my vim. Been using it raw
since I first installed it. Making these pages is quite slow when you
constantly have to add paragraphs, make lists, make the text bald and
etc, so I think emmet-vim is a good first pluging for me. Later I
would like something that would autocorrect my text lol since I am
still getting used to homerow key typing and making some mistakes from
time to time (although surprisingly no mistakes in the last sentence
:o). Aaand what else. It would be nice to browse throuhgt my system in
vim, to acces files quickly, hm ah yeah, this thing called syntax
highlighting would also be nice. That might be in one of the plugins
that the guy above in the picture has.

You don't imagine how often I think about just using sublime or some
other code editor environment where everything looks so nice and
colorful. But then I remember all those hardcore dudes on youtube that
tell you to use vim, since after climbing that steep learning curve
it's all smooth sailing from there. I wouldn't want to believe them
blindly, but when I am using octave for example or some other program,
can't remember which, AND I get to use the same keybinds like in vim
or in linux in general, I get shocked! If I learn vim and linux I can
pretty much do and edit stuff anywhere, the workflow will be so
smooth! So yeah, sticking with vim for now, will try to get some
plugins, maybe it will make my experience more enjoyable :)
