Hey look at me, once again typing in vim on Linux without any plugins.
Writing all the html tags by hand.

So, my current interests are: Kali, js, php, vim, linux shell, python.
</p>

<p>
Seems like every day I find something more intersting than I learned
was studying before. Because of the internet situation - I started to
read more. Finally opened the humble bundle thingy, found some
interesting books, about shell, python and so on&#x2026; If I was using
linux until now and would not have changed to windows, I would be
quite good in both Linux and vim by now I think. So my question still
exists&#x2026; should I do things little by little&#x2026; many things at the
same time but spending little time to each or take only JAVASCRIPT
from now on ant put my 100% effort into it. Leaving it as that for
now..

Today its evening of Wednesday. Since monday I have been without
internet on my phone, meaning - no internet at home as well. But I
stil had to study and do the ecommerce website for the sausage people,
so every day I would spend in the library just 10min on bike from me.
So far its going good, the only thing I am worried about is my bike
getting stolen and the heavy laptop that I have to carry with me all
the way there and back. But that is okay, the time in the library is
worth it. I spend 0 time wasting my time there doing random things or
waching youtube. I know that from 11:00 to 11:30 and from 15:00 to
15:30 - is the time when the room I am staying in has to be
ventilated. What that means is that I am forced to get up and take a
break. If not it, I doubt that I would take breaks. I love them so
far. I go the the very heart of my city, lie on the bench in the sun
and read a book. I would never do that if I stayed the whole day in my
appartment. Also during one of the breaks I am forced to eat or go to
the gym&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I feel that having breaks is important, I experience it myself, so
when the week is over and I am back with the internet, I will know how
to use it more mindfully.

Again I got this feeling of my computer being dirty with all the dual
boot windows and ubuntu, so I decided to install Linux solo and maybe
run a virtual box of windows when I need to use Lightroom to edit my
pictures and so on. Struggling a little wiht it once a gain, but the
muscle memory helps me. I need to get some addons for vim, I would
like to start reading manuals for vim and shell commands, get better
to know them&#x2026; would like to work with tiling window manager, like
dwm, but on a clean slate.. something like arch maybe. Now on ubuntu I
can not get it working properly, there are some gliches when I change
between the tabs in dwm and yeah&#x2026; just having all that "bloat".. it
better wouldnt be there. VIM man&#x2026; ctrl+z command that I got used to
when in Windows now is messing up my vim experience. I press it when I
want to undo something and my whole document is gone, gg :)
