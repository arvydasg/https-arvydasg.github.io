<h2 id="orgb94aab2">A Complaint</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb94aab2">
<p>
PKC group has received a complaint regarding one process due to which
nonconformity appeared in some products.
</p>

<p>
I was asked to make something so ensure the nonconformity in the
process does not repeat.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org927cf36" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org927cf36">Estonian Code</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org927cf36">
<p>
I ended up looking through 12 years old <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/">VBA</a> code which had no
documentation, most of the code was in Estonian and it’s the developer
did not want to touch his code anymore.
</p>

<p>
I took the challenge, read through the code, saw the connections,
googled a lot and finally added my own pieces of code to get the
desired outcome. I have added a few barcodes to necessary places.
</p>

<h2 id="orgcc05fd7">Created a whole app with a language I have never worked before</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgcc05fd7">
<p>
I then created a VBA app to scan those barcodes with and instructed
the shift leaders as well as other employers to use the app.
</p>

<p>
This app was implemented in 3 departments in Panevezys site, there are
plans of launching it in other sites in Lithuania as well.
</p>

<p>
The barcodes scanned with the app had to be made available for Quality
personel to check. I have created a shell script that runs at 13:00 on
a daily basis and copies the needed file from the user machine to a
location on the server so it can be accesssed.

<h2 id="org4fa7844">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4fa7844">
<p>
During this project I went from not knowing anything about VBA to
coding a fully functional app wiht it that is now used on a daily
basis and helps to prevent future nonconformities that can be made by
packing departments all around PKC.
