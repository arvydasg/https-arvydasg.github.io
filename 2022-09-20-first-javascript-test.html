Today, our codeacademy group has received our first TASK.
</p>

<p>
It didn’t seem difficult, but, after the weekended of playing with
Excels VBA, it seemed that I forgot everything that I learned in
JavaScipt.

<h2 id="org0798c4b">Looking up EVERYTHING</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0798c4b">
<p>
Honestly, I had to google/look for examples from my own <a href="https://arvydas.dev/codeacademy/javascript/index.html">sources</a> for
each and every task. I managed to complete 95% of those, BUT it didn’t
feel great that I had to keep looking things up. Of course, I have
been learning JavScript only for a month now and I didn’t really build
anything serious projects myself during this month, but still I was
hoping this test to go more smooth.
</p>

<p>
We have 3.5 hours to complete this test, but the first hour or so I
have spent tweaking my Emacs configuration (tern mode), and HTML/CSS
files trying to make the browser to display the arrays in the way I
want. After many unsuccessful attempts I have decided to do what the
task asked and execute the code in the browsers console.
</p>

<p>
After that, I managed to go through the tasks one by one and finish
them in time. Barely ;) The biggest challenge for me was the task 1.4
(adding an object to the array) and task 3 (making the cube get bigger
on each click). BUT, as we got the explanations the next day, they
seemed quite simple.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc064f02">
<p>
The language that you are learning… use it not only during the
classes, but also to build your personal projects in your free time to
ingrain all the syntax and language’s possibilities in your brain.
