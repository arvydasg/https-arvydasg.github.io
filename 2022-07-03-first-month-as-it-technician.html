So this is supposed to be a post about my first time as IT technician,
but almost 2 months have passed and I still haven’t found the time to
write it. But here it is, let’s get straight into it.
</p>

<p>
My first IT job experience. Got accepted to do two other jobs in this
company, but I firmly stated that I want to be in IT field, even if it
meant that I will be fixing printers. You know, I think it would be
easier for me to list down some points about these months, like
braindump and whenever someone wants to know more about it - I will
share more info. I can write a huge paper about those months, but it
would take just too much of my precious time. Let’s go:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Dude has decades of experience</li>
<li>Just ask to buy a new printer</li>
<li>Get your hands off me, we are conservative</li>
<li>Are these guys here part time or full time</li>
<li>Boss on vacation, who is going to take the jobs?</li>
<li>Printer master</li>
<li>Why not let everyone know that you are about to yawn</li>
<li>Amazing people working as operators</li>
<li>Remote connection to computers</li>
<li>Amazed about AD, group policies, o365 interconnection of everything</li>
<li>There is no one that can not be replaced</li>
<li>Nera nepakeiciamu, yra tik nepakeisti Just try to blow on it</li>
<li>Phats master</li>
<li>Digitalboard master</li>
<li>Boss forever busy</li>
<li>Support company</li>
<li>Passwords on shared drive</li>
<li>taking over wise things</li>
<li>Jira</li>
<li>Klaipeda</li>
<li>Cant find IT engineers in Panevezys, offered myself to be trained, agreed</li>
<li>So yeah, I already learned a lot. From what the IT field actually is to how to work with a group of people(didn’t really have this experience yet), how to work in a large company and so on.. My travels really didn’t teach me about it, so I am happy I am learning about it now.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Currently <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2022-07-03 Sun] </span></span> I am still an IT Technician that got offered
to be trained to become an IT Engineer. I am happy about it, because I
will get more time to use my head rather than my feet running from one
place to another. Hopefully I will learn about servers, AD, o365,
virtual machines, backups
</p>

<p>
At the same time, in the evenings I would like to be doing <a href="https://github.com/ossu/computer-science">this</a> course
instead of a physical 3 year course that I could be doing in my
hometown remotely after work. Thanks Remigijus for the advise. At he
same time I would like to watch as many of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/itfreetraining">these</a> videos as possible.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, there is a lot of learn! Maybe it is not a programming field,
but I think knowledge about servers and how large companies work is
quite useful to know and then someday I can switch to doing more
programming work, but for now this opportunity is good enough as a
first IT job.
</p>

<p>
Happy I wrote this. Going to watch some news with my bb :)
