<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
I noticed that there is no system whatsoever of where/when/how many things
arrive to our IT office or how many we hand out to users or production or how
many are being sent to other sites. So I created one.

<h2 id="org8010053"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> The problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Once in a while someone from Finances asks me: Who this computer belongs to?
What inv.nr sticker does it have? Who has this phone, what are the phone
numbers that PKC uses and SO ON.
</p>

<p>
I basically never have the answers, because there was no documentation.
</p>

<p>
Even a simple excel sheet with all this info written would have been better
than a stack of paper sheets with user info that PKC collected over 5 or so
years.

<p>
I have been looking for a solution for almost a week. My first attempt was
this - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PtnVvrVTCY&amp;ab_channel=TheMobileSalesEngineer">Check in / out Google Sheets</a>, it worked quite well, I was about to
present it to my Manager, but after 50scans I have figured out that it’s a paid
app. Nope. On a closer look - it was quite clumpsy to use.

<h3 id="org57af31a"><span class="section-number-3">3.2</span> Second attempt</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
Okay, now I thought I found what I need. This excelent example that uses
forms - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdqEB78cHpw&amp;ab_channel=RandyBennett">Google QR Inventory</a> I was sure will solve my problem, I just need to
tweak it a little. I tweaked, I weaked.. 3 days, I keep tweaking.. it is too
confusing with all these sheets that get created… + I keep updating my excel
data sheet and I don’t see how this could work.. I need another solution.

I am glad I did not give up after all this work. I was obsessed with a
solution, no matter where I went I was googling about this inventorization app.
I then found <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script">Google Apps Script</a> thought okay, maybe I should look into that…
then I came up <a href="https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft Power Apps</a> and thought wait, is it included in my E3
license? Went to PKC o365 admin panel, found myself, assigned a the proper
license and I can now start playing with Power apps.

I was shocked that one can create web and phone apps with Wordpress like
interface. Many videos on YouTube of how it can be done… I have found one that
resembled my case and followed it. Build Cloud Inventory Management App using
power apps and SharePoint. 24hours of intense tweaking and redoing and I have
finally made my app. It was quite simple and intuitive…
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Now I can SCAN new inv.nr as well as serial numbers and add new items AS SOON
AS they arrive to our office.</li>
<li>Whenever me or my colleague is handing out equipment from IT warehouse - they
will scan the TTR number and fill out the info to whom, when the item will be
given.</li>
<li>All of the information will be tracked in google list and achieved on our IT
Team sharepoint, so whenever anyone from financses or my manager needs to
review anything - they will be able to comfortably.</li>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
At first I wasn’t so happy doing “IT warehouse worker” job… after all I am here
to get IT experience, now warehouse experience… BUT I found a way how I can
implement my knowledge and my drive for learning new things and
automating/making processes easier in this situation. I will continue doing the
inventorization part of work, but now with an app that I have made. :)
