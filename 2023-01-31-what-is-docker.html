<p>
In almost every <a href="https://djangochat.com/">Django chat</a> podcast I hear about <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>. For me it
seems like a DevOps'ish kind of tool, but it must be useful to learn
for a freelance Django developer like myself. It sounds like an
efficient and easy way to deploy Django applications.
</p>

<p>
So, let's learn about it.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org104cd80" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org104cd80">In the beginning</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org104cd80">
<p>
If you wanted a server to store your applications onto, it had to be a
physical server in a data center. It could run ONE operating
system(OS). If you wanted another OS - you had to have another
physical center! Quite inefficient and most likely expensive.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgfe14a5d" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgfe14a5d">Then came the virtual machines.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgfe14a5d">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>you would have a server hardware</li>
<li>then on the server hardware you install a hypervisor(vmware esxi)</li>
<li>inside this hypervisor you then create as many virtual machines as
you like, assigning CPU, ram, storage by yourself. Can increase all
of these in the future if you need to.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Now you have one physical server and many virtual machines on it.
Already way more efficient than the first option.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org217d8ac" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org217d8ac">Now what is the docker about?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org217d8ac">
<p>
You still have the hardware, but on top of that you install one OS.
Ubuntu for example.
</p>

<p>
Now you install docker as any other application. It will run as
daemon. Docker will virtualize portions of our operation system. In
this case - Ubuntu to create <code>containers</code>. These containers also can run
a different OS's.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>own OS</li>
<li>own CPU</li>
<li>own memory</li>
<li>own network</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
all of it is isolated - secure. From their(container) point of view -
they are their own thing. They might as well be installed on bare
metal servers.
</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org551d268" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org551d268">Benefits of Docker</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org551d268">
<p>
Why is Docker so fast?
</p>

<p>
All the OS's, like Ubuntu, Alpine, Arch Linux, CentOS - all of them
using the SAME Linux kernel JUST LIKE the Ubuntu does ON WHICH you
have installed Docker daemon.
</p>

<p>
And with virtual machines - every time you deploy a virtual machine -
that is another linux kernel.. it also involves the hypervisor, which
is kinda heavy, so overall it's just heavy. There are more parts and
pieces that have to be running.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>Container</code> - much more simple, lightweight, fast.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
You can not mix and match windows and linux OS containers on one
machine. If you want to run windows docker machine - you must have an
underlying windows OS to run it on. Because they share the underlying
os or kernel.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org6fe2c4a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org6fe2c4a">Why docker?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6fe2c4a">
<p>
As developers - we write our app - it works great on our machines.
Then we want to either deploy it or run on other machines or give it
to a tester - something breaks, does not work.. Having a docker container prevents
this mess.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Hey, it worked on my machine!
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
No more of that junk. If you deploy in a docker container - everything
the app needs is contained in the container, it's isolated.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7c74074" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org7c74074">Microservices</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7c74074">
<p>
Usually you deploy the WHOLE app inside one container or a VM. For
example WordPress. You install WordPress server and MySQL database on
the same machine. But what you can do with docker is install wordpress
server on one container and mysql database on another. So whenever you
want to update wordpress server - you update only just that. Nothing
is in a way, nothing is conflicting, mysql database remains untouched.
Sounds good, I must try experiment with that.
