I would really like to have some actual data to work with, but I can
not find any that I would 1-know how to read, 2-know how to work with,
3-would not get frustrated just by looking at csv file full of digits
and and commas.
</p>

<p>
Creating my own dataset just by typing words and numbers in a google
sheet is possible(and probably I will end up doing that and using what
I come up with for the next two weeks), but&#x2026; I forgot what I wanted
to say.
</p>

<p>
The thing is, according to my "plan" I am supposed to be learning
about excel and statistics right now, but for some reason as I watch a
tutorial or read a book (think stats) I come up to a road block which
tells me that to continue you need to know how to use python or how to
use excel. 1-I dont know how to use python and I am supposed to learn
in in 2 weeks(according to my plan :D) and 2-I dont have excel on my
computer (need to install in on linux through vine after finding a
free ISO&#x2026;) and google sheets lacks some functions that I see
tutorials about&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Again, I don't feel that I am progressing anywhere, I am just looking
at various ways to get data, learning about various types of data and
basically finding out ways of how NOT to start learning DS :D But it's
alright, I'll get there.

<p>
Lets focus on excel for the rest of today. 16:20
</p>

<p>
Filters in excel a quite useful.
</p>

<p>
<b>Filters</b> in - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMlTDXPEjag&amp;t=21s">excel</a> are quite useful. Watching in 1.5x speed just to
get an idea of what is possible. Totals, nice. Transform your data
into a table to get an easy totals/averages and so on. You get not
only filering options but also your forumulas or charts referencing
the data - they both get updated. Kay, will keep in mind.
</p>

<p>
Formulas and Functions by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jl0Qk63z2ZY">guy</a> who works at Microsoft :D.
</p>

<p>
Been seeing median here and there, so here is a refresher:

<p>
<b>Concatenate</b> - =CONCAT(x1,x2) takes value from one row, then from the
other one that you selec and separate with comman and puts them
together in one "langeli".
</p>

<p>
<b>If</b> - <code>IF(D13</code>"smile", "yay", "boo") good times Csongor, good times ;) IF
a field equals to a word "smile", the returned value will be "yay", if
the field equals to anything else than "smile", returns the value
"boo".
</p>

<p>
<b>Countif</b> - Selecting a range of values and asking the formula to
calculate how many instances that we have specied are in the given
range. For example. =COUNTIF(B1:G7, 1) formula presents me with a
number that tells me how many numbers "1" are in the field that I
asked to look in.
</p>

<p>
<b>Vlookup</b> - things are getting more interesting. So Vlookup looks at the
table, lest say the table has two values&#x2026; you know, let me just put
an image rly quick (more vim and html practice on top of that).
</p>

<p>
So the formula that found out the favorite color of ciongibongi is as
such - =VLOOKUP(D18,D15:E18,2,FALSE)
</p>

<p>
<b>Sumif</b> - is a nice function I guess but wont make an example, I am
aware of it alright.
</p>

<p>
p.s. damn it takes a lot of time to write this html document in a
proper way. I sometimes miss Word document, but sometimes I don't. Vim
has it's own advantages, but I am new with it so I am a little bit
slow. Learned how to yank, paste a word or a whole line today.
