How good is it to work 24/7 on one particular thing?
</p>

<p>
Might Look like a great idea, you will get accoomplished a lot, right? But only
in one area. F.x. Programming. But what about your health, the body that
actually allows you to be learning this stuff. Who will take care of it? Diet,
exercise, mobility, simply movement. Who will take care of all the other things
in your life And all of this is CRUCIAL for being productive, really. You can
not have NO food and be productive. You can not have breaks where you exercise
because you wont clear you head, find new ideas and at the same time train your
mind. You must do those. Damn balance is very very important. Have to have
everything in your life in order to be good at one particular thing, no? But hm
there are examples of people who are super super good at one subject and suck
at others. Like programmers f.x, they dont rally care about their bodies right?
But its probably the battle you choose.. I personally think its important for
me to take care of my body first and ONLY and WHEN I do that I will be
productive and find time for other things. Just like at 12th grade, remember?
You had so many things on your to do list and managed to do all of them. The
more busy you are the more you can accomplish. Books, guitar, exercise, cold
showers, food, programming, shop, relatives, friends, etc etc are all possible
and should be tried to be managed. Like in todays video - streching video Says
the more you strech per day doesn't increse the benefits, but that frequency of
6 days a week and 5 minutes total for that week is what's important. 6 days a
week 5 minutes total = yield best streching results, more is simply not
necessary. This shocked me a little, simply because I agree on it and I was
acting completely different the entire last month. I would think that I am
working just because I am spending a lot of time on it, but I was simply
staying in place in terms of my progress.
</p>

<p>
Look at yourself now. Today, its 11am, you ate, you have already found time to
learn about calculus and feel good about the direction you are going to. You
did run for 10 or so mins, you did 4x10 squats with 10kg on your back, you
wanted to go to the shop but didnt take your mask with you, you came back and
took a cold shower, got into fresh clothes and went back to study and now you
are even doing stuff with your website. All of this would not have been
possible if I would have stayed with the previous or Lex Fridman mindset to
focus on one thing only. Not Lex, its mostly mine, because I have been like
this my whole life. It is either ALL or NOTHING. But maybe the middle path is
the right choice, right, Candy?

Parkinson's Law is the old adage that work expands to fill the time allotted.
Put simply, the amount of work required adjusts to the time available for its
completion.
</p>

<p>
It also illustrates very well what I was expriencing. The more time I have, the
more work will appear. But as we have seen from the streching example - more
work does not necessarily bring better results.

That in order to have a productive DAY you also have to balance out the work
and relaxation? 50% 50%?;)
