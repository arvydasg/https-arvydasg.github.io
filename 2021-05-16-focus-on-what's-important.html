<p>
Okay so before I start fixing this page to be more asthetic and all, I
have to dump out some thoughts.
</p>

<p>
I have just listened to "What I'd Do to Become A Web Developer in 6
months" by a guy named Chris. I can relate to his story and his way of
thinking.
</p>

<p>
After hearing what he has to say I realized that we also had similar
goals in mind. I am aiming to become a "programmer" at the end
of 2021. I will run out of my savings at that time and I'll either go
drive a forklift or I will be paid to program cool stuff.
</p>

<p>
But the problem is I realized was that.. yes.. just like I hate biting
an enormous 5 layer burger, the same way I am attempting to bite this
goal&#x2026; I open my mouth way too much, trying to get hold of many
comepletely new things to me (python, wordpress, php, php, css, linux,
vim, ftp, terminals, local and live servers, vscode and all that
stuff&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
YES. All of this is going to be necessary to me one day, all of this
is super interesting to me and I can't get this mindset of "know how
everything works" out of my head.
</p>

<p>
My learning process would look like this - I want to make a website
for myself. Okay, what do I need? I need a domain name, I need a
hosting provider I need some php and css background, I need to know
how to manage my servers admin panel, maybe I should build it with
wordpress, so then I need to learn that and then php would be useful
as well&#x2026; I start learning all those things first, getting wayyy off
my original goal of just simply building a website. Of course, I learn
a lot by following such a messy path, some information even get's
stuck in my head, like for example I am now comfortably using vim and
its commands, I have integrated hmtl addon so I don't have to manually
type the php tags like I did back in the day. So jumping from place to
place is a useful way of learning, BUT it doesn't give me any sense of
achievement&#x2026; To reach my goal of building a simple website I will
learn all these skills&#x2026; but that process will be endless because
there is always something to learn. I will be chasing something and
not actually use my skills. (up until now it was going good with this
story but now I have to jump, cuz I lost my train of thought.)
</p>

<p>
Okay, so my realization - I have a limited amount of time. I have to
use it to learn skills that will allow me o workd remotely and I will
enjoy such work. After checking some job ads in Lithuania, a lot of
the positions are available for junior positions. I think it would be
a good idea for me to work for someone first before doing freelancing.
Many jobs requiring hmtl, css, js, php, wordpress&#x2026; not so many
requiring python.
</p>

<p>
Right now I am heavily invested in learing python, doing a Stanford
course that I love and I am using a lof of hours of the day for it.
Then after I do php/css stuff and lastly some php. I feel like if I
dedicate lest say 4 hours to python, then 3 to css stuff and 2 to php,
I learn little bit of everything, but&#x2026; I am not good at anything and
I am moving at a really slow pace. And slow pace is not the problem in
itself is the sense of achievement perhaps.. I would like to have
something tangible in my hands that I have completed or learned.. Now,
after 3-4 months of being curious about programming I feel like I
don't know anything that could make me a living. But perpahs I don't
know how to sell mysefl.. idk.
</p>

<p>
What the Chris guy explained and that seemed like a solid strategy is
to focus on HTML / CSS for one month. (I tried this beforer wiht
machine leanring and also wiht data science) and after that, for the
second month - focus on JavaScript. Just JavaScript. My intention
would be to mix side things, learn little bit of php learn little bit
of react, learn little bit of terminal and so on and so on, but
WAIT!!!!! In this way I feel like there is no end to learning, I feel
like every waking moment of my day has to be spent learning to code,
because there is so much to learn! I skip meals, I skip workouts, I
skip meetings with loved ones, I skip reading and other random tasks
just to sit more in front of the computer and absorbe little pieces of
all sort of information that are not really realted to the thing I am
tryint to learn, which is in second month - JavaScript.
</p>

<p>
You see what I mean? After the second month of learning solo
JavaScript I would be all up until my neck in various other side
skills that I am not perfect and the JavaScript knowledge also would
not be sufficient to move to the next level&#x2026; I already imagine how
sweet my days will look like when I am learning just one topic at a
time, dedicating myself in it, asking questions that I come up with on
some forums and so on, having time for mysefl and so on.
</p>

<p>
No order
</p>

<p>
I forgot to mention what I am involved in right now:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Python course by Stanford university.</li>
<li>Html/css/Js course by Steph</li>
<li>Wordpress course by some guy on Udemy</li>
<li>Building a wordpress ecommerce site for a friend's friend</li>
<li>Fantasizing about all the books I want to read</li>
</ul>

<p>
Yes order
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Learn fron and back end web development so I can start taking jobs</li>
<li>Direction</li>
<li>Tangible things</li>
</ul>

<p>
I mean&#x2026; I kind of understand how wordpres, php and python work in
essence. I know that many things can be done and I just need to search
for it, but perhaps I could focus on those whenever I need it in my
project, little by little, no all at once now. Yes, my goal was to be
a professional with python to automate eveyday task form myself and
others, but perhaps I could first focus on the "yes order" things and
only later on what is fun&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
So does it mean that I will put aside the python project? That I am
currently almost finished with? I might, it won't run away anywhere.
Same wiht php? Yes. I should do less of the turorials and wiht that
extra headspace try to solve my own problems rather that following
someone else solving them form me.
</p>

<p>
Tutorial hell is real.
