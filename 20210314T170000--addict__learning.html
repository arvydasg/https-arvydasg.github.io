When I am learning without a plan or an idea of what I am doing, I get in this
mode of constant kind of anxiety, feeling that I can ONLY spend my time of the
things I am trying to learn, that god forbid I will waste some time by washing
clothes or getting a shave or something - all that seems like a waste of time.
</p>

<p>
But now, since I am more relaxed, following the pomodoro technique, ticking off
things from my sunday to-do list, it is only 11:30 and I have already done a
lot of things that help to keep my days(life) in balance. AND at the same time
I still have loads of time to do HOURS of learning. Productive time, with calm
mind, because other things are sorted and not at the back of my mind.
</p>

<p>
I used to be this person that gets into an "addiction" kind of mode trying to
complete and perfect a task (Revit in Denmark, Garden in Nepal, linux and other
things now). Nothing else is important, only me and the task. I am forced to
believe that this is a bad trait and I am kind of relieved thinking about it as
a bad trait, because I don't get as much work done by taking care other things
in my life, but what I realized, that the “addiction” type of work mode didn't
actually get me a lot of work done. I was just staring at the material without
understanding what it was about. So most of my effort went into the task and
only small amount of it was actually productive.
</p>

<p>
Really, for the next 6 months I will be doing this passive learning. Now it
sounds good, I like it, I got structure, I have a path, I have the reasons
“why”, now all I have to do is follow that path. It's all on me now.
</p>

<p>
5mins to write this and its so good. Just dumped it out.
</p>

<p>
p.s. Okay, I have re-read this after some hours and I see it doesn't really
make much sence if you are not ME. I think I won't always try to make my "brain
dump" material clearly understandable by others. For now, all of this is purely
for me. To practice working on a keyboard, to practice using vim, to practice
building website pages from time to time. So yeah :)
