<p>
After a bit more than a year in a tech industry I noticed the tools that are
being widely used. I have decided to adjust my workflow to using them as well.
</p>

<p>
Also, after +10 years of using the same Acer Aspire v3-771g laptop that I
puchased before finishing the highscool I have decided to buy a new one that is
lighter and one that I can carry around when going abroad with work or just the
one I can travel with. Will have windows installed on it from the beginning,
not planning to install linux.
</p>

<p>
Even though I am breezing through this text while writing it, editing it, I can
feel that my journey to Emacs/Linux(at home environment) coming to an end.
</p>

<p>
Here are a few reasons why.
</p>

<p>
I want to be as close to a regular developer as possible. To a developer that
would work in one of these big tech companies. Most of the developers in those
companies use Windows(are forced to do so), most of them use regular text/code
editors, most of them use the standard tools for time planning/writing
documentation. If I get a grasp of those tools, I will become a more valuable
professional.
</p>

<p>
Basically - I can not FULLY use Emacs in any of the workplaces together with my
team members, so I will better learn the tools they are using.
</p>

<h3 id="org9fc8e57"><span class="section-number-3">1.1.</span> Magit vs GitHub Desktop</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
Currently I am using Magit in Emacs. It's amazing. I can do all the
committing/pushing/pulling, creation/switching of branches and any other git
related task 5 times faster than someone would in Github Desktop.
</p>

<p>
BUT, because everyone is using this and it's kind of a standard - I want to get
used to using it as well.
</p>

<p>
Yes, when working by myself, freelancing and such, I could use Magit, but if I
switch to Windows - this becomes trickier since Magit is quite slow on Windows.
Another reason to try our Github Desktop.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org0ba0f01" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org0ba0f01"><span class="section-number-3">1.2.</span> Linux</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
Good news - I will continue to use Linux in everyday work when administering
services, hosting and launching my freelance products, etc. So that skill will
remain.
</p>

<p>
I have also noticed that I did not really get a valuable experience from using
Linux on a daily basis, since nothing breaks and when I find a setup that I
like(which took a lot of time and probably is where the experience really came
from) - I rarely tweak anything.
</p>

<p>
So having a linux machine at home was cool just at the beginning, when I
decided to switch from Windows to Linux thinking I will learn a lot. I did
learn a lot, that was a good move during my first days of learning to
program/getting into tech, but now I can without any worries switch back to
Windows.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0d9c065" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org0d9c065"><span class="section-number-3">1.3.</span> Putty</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
I get used to working in one type of terminal while in on my Linux machine at
home, it works different when I am on Windows machine connected through putty..
Since I am already using putty at work daily, I better use it in my free time
when doing personal projects as well.. Putty it is. Learn the ins and outs,
advantages/disadvantages/quirks of it.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org42e03cf" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org42e03cf"><span class="section-number-3">1.4.</span> Docker</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<p>
I want to get to know to docker better. Putting my few attempts to make a
project with it aside, I am not a docker professional in any way. But since I
can see myself working in Windows ecosystem for the next few or more years, I
would like to learn docker in a windows environment, using Docker desktop and
so on and not a linux version of it.
</p>

<p>
My plan is o dockerise everything on my Windows machine.

<div id="outline-container-org67c48b0" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org67c48b0"><span class="section-number-3">1.5.</span> Emacs vs vim bindings</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-5">
<p>
After working with Linux servers in my current job I have noticed that it's
quite useful if you know some vim commands.. Instead of using the arrow keys -
you can navigate through text with the keyboard - quite rewarding to know them.
</p>

<p>
So this switch to Windows will most likely mean that I will be using Emacs
less. Perhaps I will not use it at all at the beginning, to get to used to vim
bindings in my future code editors (VsCode, Pycharm?).
</p>

<p>
Learning Emacs bindings also pays off since you can use the same bindings in
Linux terminals. So that knowledge will not go to waste.

<div id="outline-container-orgc491849" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgc491849"><span class="section-number-3">2.1.</span> Org-agenda vs Jira</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
When I will be a freelancer - I <code>for sure will</code>? come back to using Emacs for
time planning. Org-agenda has a huge potential and is great for managing your
tasks in GTD manner. Using Orgzly app on android even helps to do that on your
mobile phone.
</p>

<p>
BUT.
</p>

<p>
For the sake of learning the tools that everyone uses in this industry, let's
learn Jira and the Agile way of working. For the last few months in my current
workplace I have been admiring the way our Scrum master arranges the meetings,
reviews, sprint/PI plannings, daily reviews, retro sessions and so on.. It
feels really great to work in a TEAM with agile rather than by yourself in
org-agenda.
</p>

<p>
Of course you can your tasks well planned in org-agenda, but it's only for
you..
</p>

<p>
I keep putting everything in it, form notes, to reminders to dailies to tasks..
It becomes quite a mess and hard to focus/know what to do next. With Agile, I
feel that I am learning good practices of planning ptech related tasks.
</p>

<p>
When I will be working a my own team, possibly of few people or close
programmer friends - knowing Jira and agile will come in handy way more than
knowing how to use org-agenda..

<div id="outline-container-org303d358" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org303d358"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Note taking</h2>

<div id="outline-container-org108a381" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org108a381"><span class="section-number-3">3.1.</span> Org-mode vs confluence</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
Again, I have been taking notes in org-mode for almost a few years now. I know
how/when I should use org-roam, plain-org-wiki, how to archive notes and so
on&#x2026; but again, they are for me only. These notes are quick to write and
probably will last FOREVER, since these are simply text files, but whenever I
need to add images to them, whenever I need to share them with others(yes, they
are exportable, but..) or whenever a TEAM needs to collaborate on your notes -
that is where the problems begin.
</p>

<p>
Emacs and org is kind of for one person army.. for one developer.. not for a
team to use.. and since I want to learn/be part of a team, I must use the tools
that are used by teams. In this case - confluence.
</p>

<p>
Not going to lie, I miss Emacs bindings when writing a confluence document, but
that is a small price to pay, an inconvenience I have to go through in order to
blend with the masses that use confluence for documenting all sort of
tutorials, writing tech documentation and so on. At the end of the way it's not
THAT bad of a tool.

<h3 id="org5fbb767"><span class="section-number-3">4.1.</span> Freelancing</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">
<p>
As I mentioned earlier. A time will come when I will be freelancing, building
tech solutions for clients from all around the world from my home cabin in the
forest, next to a mountains and a river. At that time I will already have time
planning/documentation/speaking my client/other programmer/developer language
and using their tools. That is much better in my opinion than using a software
that is 20 years older than me and.

<h3 id="orga0861bb"><span class="section-number-3">4.2.</span> o365 package</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">
<p>
I want to use more of that. Now have a membership of it that me and my family
uses - but I am not using to the full potential, since I am on a Linux machine.
I used Dropbox instead. Will voluntarily give my money to Microsoft on this one
just because everyone does..

<h3 id="org73d4ed0"><span class="section-number-3">4.3.</span> Newly forming habits</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-3">
<p>
As I am working on Windows machine daily - I get used to a certain way of
working. Then I come back home to a linux machine - slightly another way of
working. Takes time to adjust. Better make the both environments as similar as
possible.
