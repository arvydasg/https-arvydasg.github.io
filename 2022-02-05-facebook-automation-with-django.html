<h2 id="orgc7f61ff">What is it for</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc7f61ff">
<p>
A recently started smoothie drink powder business that is testing
itself out in the field. Instead of purchasing ads on facebook, the
client first wanted to post their content to various facebook groups
to see the engagement. Over time this tasks proved to be too tedious,
since it requires a lot of manual clicking.
</p>

<p>
I have decided to help them out by creating this automation bot that
posts to various facebook groups by itself, with client needing to
click only a few clicks. There were various facebook bots on the
internet, but you had to pay fro those. It was interesting for me to
see if I can create something like it myself.

<h2 id="orgd558af0">How it works</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd558af0">
<p>
All the user need is a link to the facebook post and a call to action
message. He then needs to input these two into the browser window and
click start. Application does the rest. Taking the data from the
groups file, going through each and every one of them and posting the
choosen content (link, ad description and a call to action message).
Leave it running, come back after a white - inspect the terminal
windows - see how many successful group posts this app has done.

<h2 id="org5fb01b2">Cons</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5fb01b2">
<p>
There are a few cons of using this script.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You can not really use the computer while it runs since it
occupiesyour mouse and you shouldnâ€™t be clicking on other windows
while it is running. You can run this script while you are having a
break, step away from your computer for 15min or so and come back
with having your post shared to 30 or so groups.</li>

<li>Your facebook account gets restricted. Often. If you are posting to
too many groups at a time. 20 or so is fine, but more than that (in
one sitting) and you are risking to get a temporary ban by facebook.</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-orgb175681" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgb175681">What to fix</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb175681">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>if the script breaks - take a screenshot of the whole screen (easier to debug what happened)</li>
<li>when the script finishes posting to one group - take a screenshot (easier to track the activity)</li>
<li>If group has pending posts - stop the for loop, run next group</li>
<li>Rebuild facebook<sub>django</sub> app with modules</li>
</ul>
