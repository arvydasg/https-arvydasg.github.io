Got into a project where the UI for the users is Django Admin. A bit unusual,
but I thought okay I will go with it. Then I realized how many gaps in my
knowledge I have when I needed to edit Django source files. Extend templates,
override default classes, etc. I am no OOP expert, never really needed to use
OOP in my projects, since they were quite simple.
</p>

<p>
Asked a few question on Django Forum, since the help was really needed.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://forum.djangoproject.com/t/show-all-the-fields-in-inline-of-the-many-to-many-model-instead-of-a-simple-dropdown/28062/9">Show all the fields in inline of the many-to-many model instead of a simple dropdown</a></li>
<li><a href="https://forum.djangoproject.com/t/understanding-the-django-admin/28151/1">Understanding the Django admin</a></li>
<li><a href="https://forum.djangoproject.com/t/thousand-separator-for-decimalfield-in-django-admin/28426">Thousand separator for DecimalField in Django Admin</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Surprisingly got some help from a guy in the Django Forum. Chatting with him on
a daily basis, learning a lot from him. Both about Django and JavaScript. He
simplifies the concepts, shows working examples and also is extremely patient
and helpful. Lucky to have his helping hand.

Presented shipping UI. Got good feedback. More changes inc.

Nice manager. Team consists seniors, not so much thriving to grow. Careful,
don't really want a lot of work, going around it. That's smart in a way, but
for me feels like blockers sometimes. Not entirely sure what they do on a daily
basis still. Don't really want to become like that one day. Should either put
myself under a lot of work, start freelancing or start looking for a position
where I would be surrounded with developers like myself.

Could not say I did anything after work hours. That's sad. But that's how it
is. Lots of stuff to learn at work, don't really want to learn AFTER work. Or
maybe the current workplace/team is meh and I am not so in a mood overall, not
really wanting to sit in front of the computer after work. Will see if it's
true the next month.

Oh yeah, I almost finished this OOP tutorial -
