<b>Bunch of thoughts will sort them during review</b>
</p>

<p>
Didn't sort the thoughts here, takes too much time.. Idk let's say these are the notes and I will clean them later as I review.
</p>

<p>
I just realized that everything can be summarized in these points
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Study groups - discussing new material, testing each other. CRUCIAL</li>
<li>Teaching - teaching other just shows you the gaps in your knowledge.</li>
<li>Deliberate - practice. Doing hard things over the easy things.</li>
<li>Little bit - wet your appetite with the topic, learn the rest later.</li>
<li>Stuff adds up - it only gets easier.</li>
<li>Set goals - deadlines and missions. Crucial for not wandering around&#x2026;</li>
</ul>

<p>
Me now as of 2021-03-29 - Don't have a goal anymore. Got discouraged
by others that if I set up big goals I will burn out. I am still
trying to get something done each day but I am choosing easy tasks
such as doing this sort of course. (I keep talking about it as it is
something negative but perhaps it will be the most useful thing I
could do). And I am spending a lot of time, uncalcualted amount of
time on the tasks.. bro.. I need those time sheets again like in UCN,
I need to track my time and sort the priorities otherwise I will feel
like I am going nowhere for the next month.

Transfer - the idea that a chunk you’ve mastered in one area can often
help you much more easily learn chunks of information in different
areas that can share surprising commonalities.
</p>

<p>
<b>Steps for making a chunk</b>:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Practice until you can sense the big-picture context</li>

<li>Understand the basic idea</li>

<li>Focused attention</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>DELIBERATE PRACTICE</b> - Focusing intently on the parts of the problem
that are the most difiult to you.
</p>

<p>
<b>Chunking</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As you gain more experience in chunking in any particular subject,
you will see that the chunks you are able to create are bigger—in
some sense, the ribbons are longer.</li>

<li>Concepts and problem-solving methods you might learn for physics can
be very similar to chunked concepts in business.</li>

<li>When you are trying to figure something out, if you have a good
library of chunks, you can more easily skip to the right solution
by—metaphorically speaking—“listening” to whispers from your diffuse
mode. Your diffuse mode can help you connect two or more chunks
together in new ways to solve novel problems.</li>

<li>"Chunking" involves compressing information more compactly&#x2013;this is
part of why it is easier to draw a "chunked" idea or concept into
mind.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Stuff on learning</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Although practice and repetition are important in helping build
solid neural patterns to draw on, it’s interleaving that starts
building flexibility and creativity. It’s where you leave the world
of practice and repetition and begin thinking more independently.</li>

<li>Once you’ve got the basic idea down during a session, continuing to
hammer away at it during the same session doesn’t strengthen the
kinds of long-term memory connections you want to have strengthened.
Worse yet, focusing on one technique is a little like learning
carpentry by only practicing with a hammer. After a while, you think
you can fix anything by just bashing it</li>

<li>Interleaving your studies—making a point to review for a test, for
example, by skipping around through problems in the different
chapters and materials—can sometimes seem to make your learning more
difficult. But in reality, it helps you learn more deeply.</li>

<li>One significant mistake students sometimes make in learning is
jumping into the water before they learn to swim. In other words,
they blindly start working on homework without reading the textbook,
attending lectures, viewing online lessons, or speaking with someone
knowledgeable. It’s like randomly allowing a thought to pop off in
the focused-mode pinball machine without paying any real attention
to where the solution truly lies.</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Acetylcholine - affects focused learning and attention.</li>

<li>Seratonin - affects social life adn risk-taking behavior.</li>

<li>Dopamine - signals in relation to unexpected reward.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Simple recall. Remember, connecting concepts isn't going to help if
you don't have the concepts already well-embedded in the brain. It's
like trying to learn higher strategy in chess without having learned
the basics about how the pieces move.
</p>

<p>
When the text is open right in front of you, it fools you into
thinking that you know the material. But you only really know that
material for certain when you can recall the material&#x2013;or at least the
key ideas&#x2013;WITHOUT the text open in front of you.
</p>

<p>
Chunking helps your brain run more efficiently. Once you chunk an
idea, concept, or action, you don’t need to remember all the little
underlying details; you’ve got the main idea—the chunk—and that’s
enough.
</p>

<p>
People get caught up in low efficiency, low intensity studying habits
and because they learned a lot slower with those methods,they end up
spending a lot more time studying.
</p>

<p>
Because they're spending a lot more time studying which is naturally
more tiring, you go into less efficient studying methods.
</p>

<p>
It's a little bit like exercising. It's as if you're not getting the
exercise results you want so you extend your workout from one hour to
two hour but now you're not working out as more intensely so you make
it four hours. Now, you really can't do more than just a light jog for
four hours or maybe just walking and eventually it eats up all of your
time but you're not having the intensity your muscles in your body
really need to get physical improvement.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, I think the same is true with mental improvement. So, what
I tried to do is I tried to pick specific chunks of time that I'm
going to study and they don't have to be too big. So, right now I'm
learning Korean over these three months and I'm actually only doing
three to four hours a day of studying time which is considerably less
than I would say a typical full-time students studying Korean. But I
think that I've been making quite good progress just because the
actual time I'm spending is highly focuses this kind of test yourself
feedback so that I am using things like Anki for flashcards and I'm
doing actual conversations one-on-one with the tutor and these things
are very efficient but they are also very intense but the benefit of
that is that you have more time and you can relax outside of it.
</p>

<p>
This is exactly what lady is talking about, deliberate practice. Time
Ferris 4 hour workweek, now this guy with learning languages. This is
the key.. Learning smart&#x2026; not wasting time to these other things.
Does it mean that what I am doing is one of those wasteful activities?
Can be..

<p>
Learning by solving solved problems.
</p>

<p>
Continuing to practice/stuyd something after your practice or master
it in a session - overlearning.
</p>

<p>
Repeating what you know is well&#x2026; easy&#x2026; this action can also bring
an illusion of competence towards the full range of the material when
you have actually learned only the easy stuff.
</p>

<p>
DELIBERATE PRACTICE - focusing only on what's difficult. (Exactly what
I am not doing now by writing some articles and stuff instead of
learning the Data science)
</p>

<p>
To know HOW is not enough. Knowing WHEN to use a technique, algorithm
or a word is as much if not even more important.

<p>
Keeping your nose to the grind is fine, but not for too long. Take
breaks. The dude's break is watching cartoons or the woman's - reading
gossip magazines. All of us have something we get away from the stuff
with, turing off all the mental stuff and enjoying whatever stupid is
in front of us. It is not only good for us it is mandatory. I think we
all know what guilty pleasure I will be having during my breaks.

Challenge each other. TEACHING is one of the best ways to learn!!!
Imagine trying to explain a subject to someone just to find out you
don't know how to start to do so. Means you don't understand it well
enough. Explainign something is a simple way will only show that you
know what you are talking about. If you are discussing with someone
about a subject and someone disagrees you have to prove your point,
all this is just strenghtening the learning!!! Makes sense?
</p>

<p>
If you are trying to explain something and you are using some vague
abstract terms, it just shows that you don't really understand the
subject and this is exactly what you need to be working on.

<h2 id="org3dea70f"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Wrong as quikcly as possible</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Try to dive in the position where you can be wrong as quickly as
possible.
</p>

<p>
While listening to a lecture there is not really a way to get antyhing
wrong. No real way to check what you have learned.
</p>

<p>
Getting to problems as quikcly as possible, trying to solve them and
failing while doing so. Great way to learn. Better than just listening
or reading. Learning languages, programming and so on. Good stuff.
</p>

<p>
Just little steps at a time, litle projects at a time. Stuff adds up.
Stuff piles up and it ONLY GETS EASIER.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
Always have a mission. 3 months for example. No concrete goals - ah I
will just learn it.." there is no specific motivation. It tapers off
and you don't atchieve that much. Like the guy learning languages. 3
months in france just reading books and going to classes - can't
speark. Spending 3 months in some other country and TALKING to natives
and so on, is able to speak the chosen language.
