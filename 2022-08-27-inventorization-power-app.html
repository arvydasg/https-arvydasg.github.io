<h2 id="orgcf66621">Intro</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgcf66621">
<p>
I noticed that there is no system whatsoever of where/when/how
many things arrive to our IT office or how many we hand out to users
or production or how many are being sent to other sites. So I created one.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga255e06" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orga255e06">The problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga255e06">
<p>
Once in a while someone from Finances asks me: Who this computer
belongs to? What inv.nr sticker does it have? Who has this phone, what
are the phone numbers that PKC uses and SO ON.
</p>

<p>
I basically never have the answers, because there was no
documentation.
</p>

<p>
Even a simple excel sheet with all this info written would have been
better than a stack of paper sheets with user info that PKC collected
over 5 or so years.

<h2 id="org65e71a0">The solution</h2>

<div id="outline-container-orga71f067" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orga71f067">First attempt</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga71f067">
<p>
I have been looking for a solution for almost a week. My first attempt
was this - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PtnVvrVTCY&amp;ab_channel=TheMobileSalesEngineer">Check in / out Google Sheets</a>, it worked quite well, I was
about to present it to my Manager, but after 50scans I have figured
out that it’s a paid app. Nope. On a closer look - it was quite
clumpsy to use.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org33fa06e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org33fa06e">Second attempt</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org33fa06e">
<p>
Okay, now I thought I found what I need. This excelent example that
uses forms - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdqEB78cHpw&amp;ab_channel=RandyBennett">Google QR Inventory</a> I was sure will solve my problem, I
just need to tweak it a little. I tweaked, I weaked.. 3 days, I keep
tweaking.. it is too confusing with all these sheets that get
created… + I keep updating my excel data sheet and I don’t see how
this could work.. I need another solution.

<div id="outline-container-orgbfe0b1a" class="outline-3">

<h4 id="org007e621">License</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org007e621">
<p>
I am glad I did not give up after all this work. I was obsessed with a
solution, no matter where I went I was googling about this
inventorization app. I then found <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script">Google Apps Script</a> thought okay,
maybe I should look into that… then I came up <a href="https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft Power Apps</a> and
thought wait, is it included in my E3 license? Went to PKC o365 admin
panel, found myself, assigned a the proper license and I can now start
playing with Power apps.

<div id="outline-container-org519e6d5" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org519e6d5">Extremely Intuitive</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org519e6d5">
<p>
I was shocked that one can create web and phone apps with Wordpress
like interface. Many videos on YouTube of how it can be done… I have
found one that resembled my case and followed it. Build Cloud
Inventory Management App using power apps and SharePoint. 24hours of
intense tweaking and redoing and I have finally made my app. It was
quite simple and intuitive…
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Now I can SCAN new inv.nr as well as serial numbers and add new
items AS SOON AS they arrive to our office.</li>
<li>Whenever me or my colleague is handing out equipment from IT
warehouse - they will scan the TTR number and fill out the info to
whom, when the item will be given.</li>
<li>All of the information will be tracked in google list and achieved
on our IT Team sharepoint, so whenever anyone from financses or my
manager needs to review anything - they will be able to comfortably.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="org0782b48">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0782b48">
<p>
At first I wasn’t so happy doing “IT warehouse worker” job… after all
I am here to get IT experience, now warehouse experience… BUT I found
a way how I can implement my knowledge and my drive for learning new
things and automating/making processes easier in this situation. I
will continue doing the inventorization part of work, but now with an
app that I have made. :)
