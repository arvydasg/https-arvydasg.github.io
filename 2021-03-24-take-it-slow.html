Everybody has some issues with procrastination. Because if
you're working on something, it means you're not working on a
lot of other things.

Zombie tube - you are happier.

<p>
<b>Difficult things - pain..</b> When you think about something you would
rather not do - you activate the areas of your brain that are
associated wiht pain. Your brain, naturally enough looks for ways to
stop that stimulation by switching your attention to something else.
Oh poor little brain is in pain :( . Neural discomfort disappears when
you start working on the actual task. Poor little baby brain gets
tricked and starts to like the activity.
</p>

<p>
<b>Reward</b> when you are done pomodoro - allow the brain to change its
focus for a little bit. Mental workout followed with a mental
relaxation.

Girl hated math her whole young life through school - now she is an
engineering professor. Started studying math at 26 when he got out of
the military! You go girl!!!! At first it was reaaaaly hard. Would
take a break and go work on some russian project stuff, then would get
back and get a better job opportunity because of her new

<p>
<b>Wasn't natural in maths and science.</b>
</p>

<p>
Math and terms are more abstract. That's why it's trickier to grasp
it. IMPORTANT TO PRACTICE strengthen the neural connections.
</p>

<p>
Neurons are linked together through repeated use. The more abstract
the subject is, the more important it is to practice it to bring those
ideas into reality. Even if the ideas are abstract, the things you
build (neurons) are real.

<p>
All at once, learning by cramming, your knowledge base will look more
like this me before this course ffs. All in a jumble with everything
confused, a poor foundation.
</p>

<p>
Study hard, take a break, look at smth else, change your
</p>

<p>
Your neural mortar will have a chance to dry. Brains diffuse mode has
a chance to work in the background.
</p>

<p>
First the pathways are not as strong, then a bit stronger and as you
practice, you don't need help to solve a particular problem, you did
some projects and all yourselfl - you will make a strong pattern.
</p>

<p>
BLEM. 10min learn - 10min study.
</p>

<p>
Pomodoro - building neural patterns you need to be more successful in
learning more challenging materials. Prevents tasks becoming OPEN
ended. Very important.

Working memory - like not very good blackboard - what you immediately
focus on fits into one of 4 chunks/slots. Things can fall out of those
slots unless we keep repeating them to hold them in mind. Grouping the

<p>
Keep repeating something to keep it in your memory.

<p>
Nice Just like the phone number. Shutting your eyes to close other
types of information to disturb you.
</p>

<p>
Long term memory - storage warehouse. info stored into different parts
of the brain. Repeat so it's easier to get to
</p>

<p>
Make a path like a road.
</p>

<p>
Working to long term memory spaced repetition. Space the info over a
certain day. 20 times one evening - not effective. 20 times over a
week - better pathways, easier to recall the information. Like trying
to build muscles all in one day.
</p>

<p>
There is no time for solid structures to grow.
</p>

<p>
Research has swon that if you try to glue things into your memory by
repeating something twenty times in one evening, for example, it won't
stick nearly as well as if you practice it the same number of times
over several days.
</p>

<p>
Repetition is needed so your metabolic vampires &#x2013; Natural dissipating
processes &#x2013; don't suck the memories away.
