<p>
After a bit more than a year in a tech industry I noticed the tools
that are being widely used. I have decided to adjust my workflow to
using them as well.
</p>

<p>
Also, after +10 years of using the same Acer Aspire v3-771g laptop
that I puchased before finishing the highscool I have decided to buy a
new one that is lighter and one that I can carry around when going
abroad with work or just the one I can travel with. Will have windows
installed on it from the beginning, not planning to install linux.
</p>

<p>
Even though I am breezing through this text while writing it, editing
it, I can feel that my journey to Emacs/Linux(at home environment)
coming to an end.
</p>

<p>
Here are a few reasons why.
</p>

<p>
I want to be as close to a regular developer as possible. To a
developer that would work in one of these big tech companies. Most of
the developers in those companies use Windows(are forced to do so),
most of them use regular text/code editors, most of them use the
standard tools for time planning/writing documentation. If I get a
grasp of those tools, I will become a more valuable professional.
</p>

<p>
Basically - I can not FULLY use Emacs in any of the workplaces
together with my team members, so I will better learn the tools they
are using.

<h3 id="orge5e69e3"><span class="section-number-3">1.1.</span> Magit vs GitHub Desktop</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
Currently I am using Magit in Emacs. It's amazing. I can do all the
committing/pushing/pulling, creation/switching of branches and any
other git related task 5 times faster than someone would in Github
Desktop.
</p>

<p>
BUT, because everyone is using this and it's kind of a standard - I
want to get used to using it as well.
</p>

<p>
Yes, when working by myself, freelancing and such, I could use Magit,
but if I switch to Windows - this becomes trickier since Magit is
quite slow on Windows. Another reason to try our Github Desktop.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org0bb0d15" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org0bb0d15"><span class="section-number-3">1.2.</span> Linux</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
Good news - I will continue to use Linux in everyday work when
administering services, hosting and launching my freelance products,
etc. So that skill will remain.
</p>

<p>
I have also noticed that I did not really get a valuable experience
from using Linux on a daily basis, since nothing breaks and when I
find a setup that I like(which took a lot of time and probably is
where the experience really came from) - I rarely tweak anything.
</p>

<p>
So having a linux machine at home was cool just at the beginning, when
I decided to switch from Windows to Linux thinking I will learn a lot.
I did learn a lot, that was a good move during my first days of
learning to program/getting into tech, but now I can without any
worries switch back to Windows.

<h3 id="org6c03452"><span class="section-number-3">1.3.</span> Putty</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
I get used to working in one type of terminal while in on my Linux
machine at home, it works different when I am on Windows machine
connected through putty.. Since I am already using putty at work
daily, I better use it in my free time when doing personal projects as
well.. Putty it is. Learn the ins and outs,
advantages/disadvantages/quirks of it.

<h3 id="org2a1df98"><span class="section-number-3">1.4.</span> Docker</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<p>
I want to get to know to docker better. Putting my few attempts to
make a project with it aside, I am not a docker professional in any
way. But since I can see myself working in Windows ecosystem for the
next few or more years, I would like to learn docker in a windows
environment, using Docker desktop and so on and not a linux version of
it.
</p>

<p>
My plan is o dockerise everything on my Windows machine.

<div id="outline-container-org99274f3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org99274f3"><span class="section-number-3">1.5.</span> Emacs vs vim bindings</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-5">
<p>
After working with Linux servers in my current job I have noticed that
it's quite useful if you know some vim commands.. Instead of using the
arrow keys - you can navigate through text with the keyboard - quite
rewarding to know them.
</p>

<p>
So this switch to Windows will most likely mean that I will be using
Emacs less. Perhaps I will not use it at all at the beginning, to get
to used to vim bindings in my future code editors (VsCode, Pycharm?).
</p>

<p>
Learning Emacs bindings also pays off since you can use the same
bindings in Linux terminals. So that knowledge will not go to waste.

<h3 id="orgbb78b36"><span class="section-number-3">2.1.</span> Org-agenda vs Jira</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
When I will be a freelancer - I <code>for sure will</code>? come back to using Emacs
for time planning. Org-agenda has a huge potential and is great for
managing your tasks in GTD manner. Using Orgzly app on android even
helps to do that on your mobile phone.
</p>

<p>
BUT.
</p>

<p>
For the sake of learning the tools that everyone uses in this
industry, let's learn Jira and the Agile way of working. For the last
few months in my current workplace I have been admiring the way our
Scrum master arranges the meetings, reviews, sprint/PI plannings,
daily reviews, retro sessions and so on.. It feels really great to
work in a TEAM with agile rather than by yourself in org-agenda.
</p>

<p>
Of course you can your tasks well planned in org-agenda, but it's only
for you..
</p>

<p>
I keep putting everything in it, form notes, to reminders to dailies
to tasks.. It becomes quite a mess and hard to focus/know what to do
next. With Agile, I feel that I am learning good practices of planning
ptech related tasks.
</p>

<p>
When I will be working a my own team, possibly of few people or
close programmer friends - knowing Jira and agile will come in handy
way more than knowing how to use org-agenda..

<h3 id="orge78b1fe"><span class="section-number-3">3.1.</span> Org-mode vs confluence</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
Again, I have been taking notes in org-mode for almost a few years
now. I know how/when I should use org-roam, plain-org-wiki, how to
archive notes and so on&#x2026; but again, they are for me only. These
notes are quick to write and probably will last FOREVER, since these
are simply text files, but whenever I need to add images to them,
whenever I need to share them with others(yes, they are exportable,
but..) or whenever a TEAM needs to collaborate on your notes - that is
where the problems begin.
</p>

<p>
Emacs and org is kind of for one person army.. for one developer.. not
for a team to use.. and since I want to learn/be part of a team, I
must use the tools that are used by teams. In this case - confluence.
</p>

<p>
Not going to lie, I miss Emacs bindings when writing a confluence
document, but that is a small price to pay, an inconvenience I have to
go through in order to blend with the masses that use confluence for
documenting all sort of tutorials, writing tech documentation and so
on. At the end of the way it's not THAT bad of a tool.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">
<p>
As I mentioned earlier. A time will come when I will be freelancing,
building tech solutions for clients from all around the world from my
home cabin in the forest, next to a mountains and a river. At that
time I will already have time planning/documentation/speaking my
client/other programmer/developer language and using their tools. That
is much better in my opinion than using a software that is 20 years
older than me and.
