<p>
Hey.
</p>

<p>
You might not notice this, but it has been a while I have written
here
</p>

<p>
A few reasons being that I have put linux, vim, data science stuff
on the shelf for a while.
</p>

<p>
I offered my help to Julytes friend that is starting a sausage
business and needed a website.
</p>

<p>
I am using wordpress and building that. I have also noticed that I
really need to have strong hmtl and css skills to be able to build a
proper wordpress site. I also noticed I should know some php as well
</p>

<p>
So during my time in Vilnius, it is 4th week now, I have been
learning that. Most of the time got taken by figuring wordpress out,
now since that is done, I am looking into hmtl and css and that is
getting more clear.
</p>

<p>
What I have learned now is how to color the things, got an idea how
to work wiht the blocks and make stuff responsive in mobile.
Tomorrow I think I will nail that with Steph's classe.
</p>

<p>
You might think why don't I learn that right now - I'll tell you
why. I am trying to divide my time a little. For now there are 3
parts. Python - Html/css - wordpress.
</p>

<p>
As of now I have done the first two, time will be for wordpress.
</p>


<p>
<b>Python</b>
</p>

<p>
Dalykai kurie sekasi: karel done. Short input and math stuff is
clear. What I want to learn: how to use external files/programs
from python to start doing some useful stuff.
</p>

<p>
<b>Html/css</b>
</p>

<p>
Dalykai kurie sekasi: basic text editing, styling, etc. What I
would like to know: how to work with those responsive design
boxes, mobile layouts and etc.
</p>

<p>
<b>Wordpess</b>
</p>

<p>
Dalykai kurie sekasi: manual backups, elementor templates for
various parts of the site (head, nav, footer, single page etc).
What I would like to know: how to edit php files and find a way to
show only what I want. Make website faster as well.
