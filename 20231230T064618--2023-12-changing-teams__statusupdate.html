This is one of the last days of 2023, thought I would write about the whole
year instead of the December only. I did not have any status update or anything
written about my new workplace(<a href="20220703T191800--first-month-as-it-technician__statusupdate.html">like I did with the last workplace</a>), so here we
go.

<h2 id="org49e0e40"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> 2023-04 - Now at SEB</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Migrated the whole working environment (including ~5 services) of +20 people
from RHEL7 to RHEL8</li>
<li>Installed SAS Viya</li>
<li>Got a change to work with SAS code</li>
<li>Integrating Github in SAS Viya</li>
<li>Realizing what the corporate workflow looks like, nothing goes fast here</li>
<li>Professionals on every corner, just need to know who the right person is to
solve the problem</li>
<li>Deadlines are not really deadlines, don't stress over them</li>
<li>Chill way of workng, no rush</li>
<li>Working in Linux terminal practically for almost a year - I feel very
confident in it</li>
<li>Using Tmux at work, extremely beneficial</li>
<li>Able to install and use Emacs at work</li>
<li>Practically no python work. Sad, since I was applying to a "Python full stack
developer" position</li>
<li>Had to found ways to use python at work by myself. Found a few opportunities
to automate some tasks and make my life easier anyway</li>
<li>"Access rights app" is one of such tasks. Got tired of manually granting
various access rights to users, so created a Django app that let's to make
this process easier for myself and my colleagues developers.</li>
<li>Got a chance to present this app to a large audience, was comfortable doing
so, since I did everything myself and I felt that I could answer any question</li>
<li>By trying to set up WSL the proper way according to work tutorials, just
because it was not working properly, I kept digging and found another person
that had a solution he built himself. It involved <a href="20231211T151427--first-nixos-installation__nixos.html">NixOS</a>. I tried it, I liked
it, now it's my main development OS. Ofc it's config <a href="https://github.com/arvydasg/dotfiles/blob/f2917f144ea2f2735002f3fac8f18230422ffad3/nixos/configuration.nix">is not large now</a>, but
still.</li>
<li>Met an Emacs user in SEB! So know I know we are 2!</li>
<li>Realized how a strong team leader is very important</li>
<li>I can see how excited and full of motivation and drive I was at the beginning
of joining SEB and how drained I am now, perfect time to join a new team</li>
<li>December has been the worst this year in terms of performance and growth. Not
getting proper tasks during sprint plannings, migration that we focused so
much to finish, deadline got postponed for another year&#x2026; got back to SAS
installation, fixing bugs left and right, not sure if I will be able to
continue working on the rights app, stuck with AD automation tasks due to
holiday period</li>
<li>More free time during my last month in the current team, able to do my own
thing more, configuring emacs, getting ready for real development work in my
favorite environment at the new team</li>
