Ok let me think out real quick. I have got around 10 python scripts
that I would like to share to my website for people to interract. Part
of the scrips will require only to enter a number and view the result.
Others will require to upload files for the script to be ran.. There
will be some sort of communication between the user and the python
program in the website.
</p>

<p>
I think it would be cool to do that so I could show my projets to friends and family members.
</p>

<p>
So far I have seen many tools for simialr tasks. Something that starts with B.. django and flask were mentioned I think, some other frameworks or how to call them.
</p>

<p>
Just have to see which one works with the most basic code in my now php website and then upload the rest.

Been doing some python exercises form Code in Place and I came up to
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/">w3schools</a> with a hope to find an explanation how to work with
functions inside other functions, reuse their returned information and
so on. (that would be really useful for me when working wiht images).
So I came up to this python interpreter I can say? It runs the code
that w3schools asks us to run, BUT if I put my own code - it doesn't
execute.

<p>
So, if w3schools cant make it work properly, like.. I am thinking
now.. make a browser have all the functions that python has&#x2026;? Is it
even possible? Well, definitely not for me, not for now. I will stick
to making a blog wiht all the cool functions that I learned so I can
execute them anywhere, from anyones computer just by looking up on my
website.

Wrote the same question again - running python script in the browser.
Opened like 10-15 links, will watch them all and see if I find
something suitable for myself. If not - I will just upload the code
and that's it.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Brython - aims to replace Javascript for web scripting. It
allows you to directly use Python Scripts on a webpage to handle
DOM (Document Object Model) elements and events, all using our
favorite language Python.</li>
<li>Flask - deploying python script as a flash app to google app
engine. Looks promising, user gets to put his input, then
getting the result in an html page. Sounds good to me, but is it
free tho? But first let me finish checking the other 15 opened
solutions.</li>
<li>Python anywhere - not free</li>
<li>Anvil - seems free</li>
<li>cgitb" library?</li>
<li>Trinket is a python interpreter for a website. Also an option?
Works when chaning inches to feet, but when I tried to run an
image editing script, it told me that SimpleImage can not be
imported. Upsy daisy.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Okay, most likely I will not try to get any interpreters or apps to
run my scripts on my website. Placing just the code itself will
suffice for now and when I learn little bit more about python django,
flask and stuff like this, I will come back to this post and use the
methods tht I found to host and use my scripts online. By that time I
will probably have some coool scripts :p Looking forward to that.
Okay, bye for now. Going to do some web dev stuff :)
