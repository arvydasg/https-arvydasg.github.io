<p>
Okay, so as the title indicates, I will talk about 3 things.
JavaScript, Crypto and Busyness(being busy).
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org6b56b4e" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org6b56b4e">Javascript</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6b56b4e">
<p>
Today is the day I decided to start looking into JavaScript
programming language. I feel a certain aversion towards it, I imagine
that I can do exact same things with python as with JavaScript, so I
don't really have to learn it, I should just stick with Python&#x2026; BUT,
I later realized, that come on man, learn Javascript, its on every
"web dev roadmap", later you will have to learn raact, because
everyone is using it, and Lithuania job adds require that as well.
Both use Javascript, so might as well learn it. Put the php aside,
focus on your thrird language - Javascript.
</p>

<p>
As I am writing this I just realized that the majority of my time
learning programming so far I spend time making decisions. Or thinking
aobut the decisions I have previously made, or adjusting to those
decisions.
</p>

<p>
Just because I didnt have anything mentoring me or guiding me "How to
use programming so you could work remotely from the mountains or from
the beach while travelling in a van and make a living off it". I
started as a "machine learning guy" with Andrew Ng coursera course.
Then I got interested in Linux a lot. Then I thought I will do some
data science and use python a lot. Then I got an offer to build an
eccomerce site and changed my attention to web development, which I am
fousing on these days. I think starting off programming as a Machine
learning engineer would be a quite big thing to chew on, I relize now
that me getting down a few levels is a good idea and starting with the
webdev path is a good choice. It helps me to understand the whole
programming type of lifestyle.
</p>

<p>
I start seeeing that all these fields that I tried dipping my toes in
using similar kind of langauges even thought they are named
differently. Now, learning Javascript, I can skip throught many
beginning tutorials, because I have heard about the "variables,
functions, etc" material before, in machine learnign and python
courses that I took. So that is good news for me. I just glanced at an
email I got with ecommerce shop examples and lost my train of thought.
Choo choo&#x2026; on to the next topic.

<div id="outline-container-org9a17cbf" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org9a17cbf">Crypto</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9a17cbf">
<p>
So, today Julyte decided to buy crypto currencty, I thought about it
as well, it might be an intersting thing to get involved, overlooking
all the possible dangers. To help her a little with It I watched this
video. It is so far first and only video I have wached about crypto
currency. I heard one podcast before and thought that all this is not
really form me right now, I am too busy learning programming to get
involved in something like this.this video
</p>

<p>
After watching a video I made a summary of the talking points and
realized that there are a lof of things to consider when getting into
all this crypto thing. Especially about security.. Hackers are
constantly trying to get into your wallet, trying to get into your
prefered gates that you use to buy crypto, wallets.. dangers are
everywhere and you are alone in this, you can not really call
customers service and ask for help. You are your own bank and you are
responsible for its safety. I might give it a try one day, just
curious how it works. Will do it with litle amounts, with all the
notebooks and stuff.

<div id="outline-container-orga8f3803" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orga8f3803">Busyness</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga8f3803">
<p>
Quite a strange title, I know. It is just a direct translation from
Lithuanian. Uzimtumas means Busyness. There is a goverment institution
that is making sure the unemployed people stay busy. So today I got a
call from them, because I am unemployed at the moment, explained about
my situation, that I am learning to program for a few monhts now and
that I am building an eccomemrce site and so on.. she seemed okay wiht
my answer, and after I asked her if there are any courses provided by
the country for people like me, she advised me to read this article.
In it, the sitution of a girl, who finished a certain course story is
being told, how she can not find a job and she is being pressed by the
government to find a job, otherwise she will have to return the
tuition fees and so on&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Not sure why she shared it with me, but I am not taking any such
courses and will continue learning by myself. I already see the
progress and I know way more things than I did when I started. Its
cool to see yourself progress.
