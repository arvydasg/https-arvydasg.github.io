<p>
I think people don’t want to blog is because they’re worried about
taking time away from coding. But that's not true! Here are a few
reasons why blogging is actually a very helpful way to learning
coding.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Forces in Depth Research</b> - if you start writing about fundamental
topics, such as Python’s OOP, it’ll require you to research that
topic vigorously. This results in you reading multiple blog posts,
book chapters, and lots of code. I doubt many people will read such
post, but now I truly understand how to use it and even better I use
that post as a quick reference when coding.</li>

<li><b>Forces Practice</b> - if you really want to grasp something well enough
to blog about it, you need to practice using it i.e. you need to
code.</li>

<li><b>Forces Reflection</b> - For one of my personal projects I blogged about
each milestone I reached. For instance if I added a Command Line
Interface to my app I blogged about it. This meant I had to go back
through my code and reflect on why I wrote it that way. You should
be doing this anyways but blogging about it forced me to really
scrutinize my code, highlighted errors, and always left me with
improved knowledge and skills.</li>

<li><b>Creates References</b> - I already mentioned this in #1 but I think it
warrants its own spot in this list. Once you’ve written a post on a
topic you can refer back to it anytime. This reduces time spent
brushing up on a topic because you know exactly where to find your
post.</li>

<li><b>Creates a Timeline of Your Progress</b> - by blogging consistently while
you’re learning to program, you’re chronicling the evolution of your
skills. Seeing my progress from post to post has been incredibly
rewarding and keeps me motivated. I’ve also been told that potential
employers like to see this as well, so if a side effect is it helps
me/you get a job, SWEET!</li>
