<p>
Just came back to the library after another "desinfection" thing for
30min, was sitting in the square, sun was shining, was reading the
Turing paper, eating some ice cream, taking a walk.
</p>

<p>
As I was coming back to the library, I saw a guy that was literally
burned by the sun. I thought&#x2026; Is it better for me to sit in the sun
10 minutes a day and get an okey tan or sit once for 5 hours a day and
get a sick tan..
</p>

<p>
Maybe its the same with learning to program. Why don't I learn little
by little daily, same like doing duolingo little by little daily, same
like learning guitar little by little daily&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
At least I would be doing something, learning something little by
little and progressing little by little. Instead of picking a subject,
going all in and then burning out.
</p>

<p>
Little bit of Js, php, spaninsh, kali, python and etc daily&#x2026;
