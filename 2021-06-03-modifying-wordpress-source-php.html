<p>
Since I MUST know what is underneath the hood when learning something
new, the time has come to see under the Wordpress hood.
</p>

<p>
There is lots of linked php files, lots of functions, variables and so
on. I want to understand how they relate to each other and how to
modify the files to my liking. Yesterday after doing a little bit of
digging I have managed to change for some reason not transacted
woocommerce checkout field text, hopefully today I will manage to find
how to translate the "view card" button. Then my site will be fully
translated to Lithuanian
</p>

<p>
Yep, to get a better idea of whats happening I will watch a video "How
to customize WooCommerce with PHP snippets". No internet, so I will
have to focus on it alone. Let's go.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Create a child theme.</li>
<li>Don't edit your theme and your WC plugin files. Next time a theme or
plugin update comes in - it will wipe all your updates.</li>
<li>Don't use WP editor, use FTP. If you forget a comma or smth, the
site will break and its hard to recover. Use FTP. Create BACKUPS of
the files you're currently modifying.</li>
<li>Don't verride tempates. take advantage of do<sub>action</sub>. That's the
beauty of php.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Okay so nice, you can add a snippet of code to your funtions.php
(which resides in the child theme, right? A function for example to
see the "UNITS SOLD" of an item, or better yet, think of something
your really need, you can add. ALL the information about he products
is already sitting in the database. The fields in the DB are already
created by the WooCommerce guys. What I am doing as a developer is
just taking the information and displaying to the screen. Cool man&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Nice, so there is a single.php, header.php, footer.php, products.php
and so on&#x2026; if you make an update to one, the changes will appear to
the all of the single pages for exmple. And there just soo many files
that can be to modify&#x2026; not many, relly. So you will always find a
way to customize something you want.
</p>

<p>
What, where in the page, on witch page.
</p>

<p>
Instead of copying the old template and changing the php or the html,
you can simply HOOK your own function from your functions.php file
without having to change anything in WC template?
</p>

<p>
actions - add, filters - modify existing content.
</p>

<p>
ALL the possible hooks you can add on specific pages. Check it out.
Super helpful, was expecting something like this.
</p>

<p>
Priority 1 - above the title, priority - 6, under the title.
</p>

<p>
So everything is happening in your functions.php. You can add<sub>action</sub>,
remove<sub>action</sub> (then copy the whole line with priorities and stuff you
want to remove). Wow, this is exactly what I wanted.

<h2 id="org3e796f4">Second tutorial</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3e796f4">
<p>
Name of it - Wordpress produtct catalog - how to create a custom
wordpress catalogue.
</p>

<p>
What is sas? Compiling css code to style.css file? huh?
</p>

<p>
Dude using bootstartp, it does all the styling for him when he sets
classes to items? Interesting.
</p>

<p>
Loading js into his theme&#x2026; throught functions.php
</p>

<p>
33:34 he is using some bootstarp I will assume again? Changing class
of the item with "mb-4" which means margin-bottom=4; and it magically,
somehow changes the css of the file.
</p>

<p>
These both, especially the last tutorial was amazing&#x2026; I learned so
much, just need to practice. Jquery, bootstrap, catalogs, creating
custom stuff with php. The guy is so confided wiht every action of
his. Should look him up and watch some more tutorials. This is exactly
how I felt when I was doing the Revit stuff. And why I was so
confident? Because I spend a lot of time on it and was breaking a lot
of stuff!!! Yes my brother, break stuff.
</p>

<p>
Time to get dressed and go to the library fetch some internet, learn
some js finally with Steph.
</p>

<p>
15:51
</p>

<p>
So far no js, because I have been optimizing the client's websites SEO
(for the first time, learned a lot), then now I found some php files
that will allow me to edit the damn checkout page and some words that
did not get translated to Lithuanian, I will manually edit the theme
files of woocommerce plugin throught FTP, then update the woocomerce
theme(yes! an update just in time for my testing purposes) and see if
the changes remained or not.
