Alright, hi. Two weeks of my learning excel and statistics are nearly
over, and what I am doing? Installing windows so I could play video
games.
</p>

<p>
On ubuntu, I don't have excel. I see everyone using excel and I don't
want to spend my time trying to do the same tasks with google sheets
or some ubuntu alternative programs, because it won't be the same.. I
prefer excel as well, don't know why. So, reason nr.1 why I need
Windows.
</p>

<p>
There are some tasks that I need and want to do with my images&#x2026; it
is just way easier to modify them and sort them and pick the proper
ones in the software that I am familiar with - Lightroom. To be
learning another software (Gimp, darkroom or RawTherapee on top of
learning Vim, Linux, data science stuff is a bit too much I feel.
Especially after a month me trying to juggle all of those things at
the same time and feeling like I am going through too much of
unecessary struggle&#x2026; Just get Windows and use Lightroom to sort all
the pictures stuff you have been holding on your to-do list for months
now&#x2026; thats reason nr.2
</p>

<p>
Another reason is that I feel like I would like to give myself a break
from learnign somehow. I know that I tend to get into things too fast
and too deep, which is unhealthy sometimes, that is why I started to
do the Learing how to learn course in which I have already, during the
fist week found a lot of "mistakes" with the way I approach learning.
One is I see learning anything as a sprint. The more time I put in,
the faster and more I will learn. But I start to learn to see it as a
marathon, rather than the sprint. I must have some breaks, I must
reward myself somewhow and that reward will be wow. My addiction that
I had for years. Hehe :D I don't know if it is because I feel a little
bit sick now from walking outside half naked during the first days of
the "spring" or I am conciously letting myself get loose into
something I rarely find a smooth way out of, but maybe I should try to
live with my flaws rather than shutting them down, because I noticed
that it is like a rubber band, the more I pull it, the more it
backfires later. Keep the balance. everything in moderation. Let's try
this Arvy ;)
</p>

<p>
Oh yes there is another reason. The fan of my laptop while I am
running ubuntu. It is constantly at nearly critical high temperature,
which doesn't allow me to focsu.. the sound that my poor 8 year old
laptop is making is hard to listen to. Instead of looking for a cure
to this, I will just remove the problem, whihc is - ubuntu after every
clean install.

<p>
Also, I can see this as a good learning opportunity. I have never
tried to dual boot anything on my or someone else's computer. I just
remember Pali Pali dude from my Uni that had windows on his mac for
similar reasons. That's it. Now I will know how to do it as well.
</p>

<p>
And yes, I will continue using ubuntu and other linux systems for my
daily learning/website stuff and pretty much 80-90% of the time,
since I want to learn the system, but for the remaining 20% and the
reasons mentioned above it's going to be windows :)
</p>

<p>
Let's see how I am going to manage, curious to see myslef in a half a
year. I will definitely not crumble, since the Linux system is just so
much more efficient I feel, I love using the terminal and and can't
imagine mysefl editing text or code in anything else than Vim right
now. So I am comforatble letting myself loose on not so major tasks
like wow and image editing, since I will always come back to linux for
my data science journey. So cheesy.
</p>

<p>
Alright, I continue being sick. Glad I found the time to type this one
out.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
p.s. I should probably try to find some addon thingy for vim that
would auto-correct the typing mistakes. I am fast as a lightning with
this home row typing now, but sometimes a mistake slips in I guess.
Sorry about that, I'll do somethig about it.
