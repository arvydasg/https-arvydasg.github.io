Hey.
</p>

<p>
You might not notice this, but it has been a while I have written here
</p>

<p>
A few reasons being that I have put linux, vim, data science stuff on the
shelf for a while.
</p>

<p>
I offered my help to Julytes friend that is starting a sausage business and
needed a website.
</p>

<p>
I am using wordpress and building that. I have also noticed that I really
need to have strong hmtl and css skills to be able to build a proper
wordpress site. I also noticed I should know some php as well
</p>

<p>
So during my time in Vilnius, it is 4th week now, I have been learning that.
Most of the time got taken by figuring wordpress out, now since that is done,
I am looking into hmtl and css and that is getting more clear.
</p>

<p>
What I have learned now is how to color the things, got an idea how to work
wiht the blocks and make stuff responsive in mobile. Tomorrow I think I will
nail that with Steph's classe.
</p>

<p>
You might think why don't I learn that right now - I'll tell you why. I am
trying to divide my time a little. For now there are 3 parts. Python -
Html/css - wordpress.
</p>

<p>
As of now I have done the first two, time will be for wordpress.
</p>


<p>
<b>Python</b>
</p>

<p>
Dalykai kurie sekasi: karel done. Short input and math stuff is clear. What
I want to learn: how to use external files/programs from python to start
doing some useful stuff.
</p>

<p>
<b>Html/css</b>
</p>

<p>
Dalykai kurie sekasi: basic text editing, styling, etc. What I would like
to know: how to work with those responsive design boxes, mobile layouts and
etc.
</p>

<p>
<b>Wordpess</b>
</p>

<p>
Dalykai kurie sekasi: manual backups, elementor templates for various parts
of the site (head, nav, footer, single page etc). What I would like to
know: how to edit php files and find a way to show only what I want. Make
website faster as well.
