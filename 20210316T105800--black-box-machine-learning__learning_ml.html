<h2 id="orga6ecb4c"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Classification algorithms</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
There is a lot of classification algorithms available now but it is
not possible to conclude which one is superior to other. It depends on
the application and nature of available data set. For example, if the
classes are linearly separable, the linear classifiers like Logistic
regression, Fisherâ€™s linear discriminant can outperform sophisticated
models and vice versa.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org561c8b3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org561c8b3"><span class="section-number-3">1.1.</span> Decision Tree</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">

<figure id="org8ed823c">
<img src="./media/decision-tree.png" alt="decision-tree.png" width="1200px">

</figure>

<p>
Decision tree builds classification or regression models in the form
of a tree structure. It utilizes an if-then rule set. The rules are
learned sequentially using the training data one at a time. Each time
a rule is learned, the tuples covered by the rules are removed. This
process is continued on the training set until meeting a termination
condition.
</p>

<p>
The tree is constructed in a top-down recursive divide-and-conquer
manner. All the attributes should be categorical. Otherwise, they
should be discretized in advance? Attributes in the top of the tree
have more impact towards in the classification and they are identified
using the information gain concept.
</p>

<p>
A decision tree can be easily over-fitted generating too many branches
and may reflect anomalies due to noise or outliers. An over-fitted
model has a very poor performance on the unseen data even though it
gives an impressive performance on training data.
</p>

<p>
This can be avoided by pre-pruning which halts tree construction early
or post-pruning which removes branches from the fully grown tree.
What?

<h3 id="org9b1ef1f"><span class="section-number-3">1.2.</span> Naive Bayes</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier inspired by the Bayes
theorem under a simple assumption which is the attributes are
conditionally independent.
</p>


<figure id="org233d351">
<img src="./media/naive-bayes-formula.png" alt="naive-bayes-formula.png" width="1200px">

</figure>

<p>
Naive Bayes is a very simple algorithm to implement and good results
have obtained in most cases. It can be easily scalable to larger
datasets since it takes linear time, rather than by expensive
iterative approximation as used for many other types of classifiers.
</p>

<p>
Naive Bayes can suffer from a problem called the zero probability
problem. When the conditional probability is zero for a particular
attribute, it fails to give a valid prediction. This needs to be fixed
explicitly using a Laplacian estimator?.

<div id="outline-container-org64a93e7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org64a93e7"><span class="section-number-3">1.3.</span> Artificial Neuraul Networks</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
Artificial Neural Network is a set of connected input/output units
where each connection has a weight associated. During the learning
phase, the network learns by adjusting the weights so as to be able to
predict the correct class label of the input tuples.
</p>

<p>
There are many network architectures available:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Feed-forward</li>

<li>Convolutional</li>

<li>Recurrent</li>
</ul>

<p>
There can be multiple hidden layers in the model depending on the
complexity of the function which is going to be mapped by the model.
Having more hidden layers will enable to model complex relationships
such as deep neural networks.
</p>

<p>
However, when there are many hidden layers, it takes a lot of time to
train and adjust wights. The other disadvantage of is the poor
interpretability of model compared to other models like Decision Trees
due to the unknown symbolic meaning behind the learned weights.
</p>

<p>
But Artificial Neural Networks have performed impressively in most of
the real world applications. It has high tolerance to noisy data and
is able to classify untrained patterns. Usually, Artificial Neural
Networks perform better with continuous-valued inputs and outputs.
</p>

<p>
All of the above algorithms are eager learners since they train a
model in advance to generalize the training data and use it for
prediction later.

<p>
k-Nearest Neighbor is a lazy learning algorithm which stores all
instances correspond to training data points in n-dimensional space.
When an unknown discrete data is received, it analyzes the closest k
number of instances saved (nearest neighbors)and returns the most
common class as the prediction and for real-valued data it returns the
mean of k nearest neighbors.

There are several methods exists and the most common method is the
holdout method. In this method, the given data set is divided into 2
partitions as test and train 20% and 80% respectively. The train set

data, I see now) will be used to test its predictive power.

<p>
ROC curve is used for visual comparison of classification models which
shows the trade-off between the true positive rate and the false
positive rate. The area under the ROC curve is a measure of the
accuracy of the model. When a model is closer to the diagonal, it is
less accurate and the model with perfect accuracy will have an area of
1.0

<p>
Support vector machine is highly preferred by many as it produces
significant accuracy with less computation power. Support Vector
Machine can be used for both regression and classification tasks. But,
it is widely used in classification objectives.
</p>

<p>
The objective of the support vector machine algorithm is to find a
hyperplane in an N-dimensional space(N â€” the number of features) that
distinctly classifies the data points.
</p>

<figure id="org3894953">
<img src="./media/hyperplanes2.png" alt="hyperplanes2.png" width="1200px">

</figure>

<p>
To separate the two classes of data points, there are many possible
hyperplanes that could be chosen. Our objective is to find a plane
that has the maximum margin, i.e the maximum distance between data
points of both classes. Maximizing the margin distance provides some
reinforcement so that future data points can be classified with more
confidence.

<figure id="org957cebc">

</figure>

<p>
Hyperplanes are decision boundaries that help classify the data
points. Data points falling on either side of the hyperplane can be
attributed to different classes. Also, the dimension of the hyperplane
depends upon the number of features. If the number of input features
is 2, then the hyperplane is just a line. If the number of input
features is 3, then the hyperplane becomes a two-dimensional plane. It
becomes difficult to imagine when the number of features exceeds 3.
</p>


<figure id="org1ccc11e">
<img src="./media/support-vectors.png" alt="support-vectors.png" width="1200px">

</figure>

<p>
Support vectors are data points that are closer to the hyperplane and
influence the position and orientation of the hyperplane. Using these
support vectors, we maximize the margin of the classifier. Deleting
the support vectors will change the position of the hyperplane. These
are the points that help us build our SVM.

Logistic Regression was used in the biological sciences in early
twentieth century. It was then used in many social science
applications. Logistic Regression is used when the dependent
variable(target) is categorical.

<li>To predict whether an email is spam (1) or (0)</li>

<p>
K-means clustering is one of the simplest and popular unsupervised
machine learning algorithms.
</p>

<p>
The objective of K-means is simple: group similar data points together
and discover underlying patterns. To achieve this objective, K-means
looks for a fixed number (k) of clusters in a dataset.
</p>

<p>
A cluster refers to a collection of data points aggregated together
because of certain similarities.
</p>

<p>
Youâ€™ll define a target number k, which refers to the number of centroids you need in the dataset. A centroid is the imaginary or real location representing the center of the cluster.
</p>

<p>
Every data point is allocated to each of the clusters through reducing
the in-cluster sum of squares? Hm?

</p>

<p>
Cross-validation is a statistical method used to estimate the skill of
machine learning models.
</p>

<p>
It is commonly used in applied machine learning to compare and select
a model for a given predictive modeling problem because it is easy to
understand, easy to implement, and results in skill estimates that
generally have a lower bias than other methods.
</p>

<p>
Oh, so there are even methods to compare and select a model?!? Why do
you even need humans for then? Let the machine face a problem, it will
select the method to solve it and then solve it. Uh, even data
scientists might become unecessary soon. Overexaggerating of course,
but damn.
