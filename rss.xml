<p>
In my free time between my work, my python course, dev job search,
etc, I was building a flask application for quotes that I have
gathered during the years. I wanted this project to be finished, to be
live. For that I need to host it.
</p>

<p>
Will share with you how I did it.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgd0a4afb" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgd0a4afb"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Apache vs nginx</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Will just leave it here.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Also, one thing I would like you to know is that Apache is a threaded
server, which means it is prone to <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/#:~:text=Insights-,What%20is%20a%20DDoS%20attack%3F,a%20flood%20of%20Internet%20traffic.">DDOS</a> and DOS attacks. But Nginx on
the other hand is an asynchronous web server and <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/reverse-proxy/#:~:text=A%20reverse%20proxy%20is%20a,security%2C%20performance%2C%20and%20reliability.">reverse proxy</a>, so it
is not as vulnerable as Apache, and it is also very easy to set up.
</p>

<h2 id="org7948fef"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Get yourself a virtual private server(VPS)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
This time I was using Linode, since I got some free credits with it,
but every provider is basically the same.
</p>

<p>
Create new linode:
</p>


<figure id="org947a05d">
<img src="./static/images/linode.png" alt="linode.png" width="1200px">

</figure>

<p>
Wait for it to be provisioned(2-3min).
</p>

<p>
Connect to it over ssh.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">ssh root@139.xx.xx.xx
</pre>
</div>

<p>
replace xx with your server ip address. Enter the credentials that you
have set up for it. And you should now be inside your server!
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">sudo apt update
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgde76f1c" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgde76f1c"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Install nginx</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">sudo apt install nginx
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Create a configuration for nginx web server
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash"><span style="color: #fe8019;">cd</span> /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/flask_app
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This should be the content of this file:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">server <span style="color: #fe8019;">{</span>
<span style="color: #cd5c5c; background-color: #3c3836;"> </span>   listen 80;

<span style="color: #cd5c5c; background-color: #3c3836;"> </span>   location / <span style="color: #cc241d;">{</span>
<span style="color: #cd5c5c; background-color: #3c3836;"> </span>   <span style="color: #cd5c5c; background-color: #3c3836;"> </span>   proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;

<span style="color: #cd5c5c; background-color: #3c3836;"> </span>   <span style="color: #cc241d;">}</span>
<span style="color: #fe8019;">}</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If you got to your server's ip now - you will see nginx default
config, we need to unlink it so it uses our config.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">sudo unlink /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
<span style="color: #928374;"># </span><span style="color: #928374;">if previous step succeeds, do this:</span>
sudo nginx -t
sudo nginx -s reload
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Refresh the webpage(will get "bad gateway", because nginx is trying to
connect to localhost port 8000, because we don't have a webserver
running there. That is why we will user <a href="https://gunicorn.org/#quickstart">Gunicorn</a>.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgcbd4947" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgcbd4947"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Let's run project</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">sudo apt install python3-pip
<span style="color: #928374;"># </span><span style="color: #928374;">go to the source folder of your project</span>
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
</pre>
</div>

<p>
At this point you can do <code>python3 run.py</code> and go to the port 5000 or w/e
you set up.
</p>

<p>
If you still can not see your webpage - make sure that <code>host="0.0.0.0",</code>
is written next to <code>debug=True</code>.
</p>

<p>
0.0.0.0 adapts to any ip address where this app is being hosted.
</p>

<p>
Now it works! Your application is live! Magic!
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1fa1c9e" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org1fa1c9e"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> Gunicorn</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
"This is currently a development server and not good for production
since if multiple users try to connect to the server, they will not be
able to do it." (actually works, I just checked on my phone.)
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">sudo apt install gunicorn3
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Set workers and tell which files contain flask app
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash"><span style="color: #928374;"># </span><span style="color: #928374;">(run - name of the file, app - app object?)</span>
gunicorn3 --workers=3 run:app
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now go to the server's ip, port 8000, as the gunicorn is listening -
NOTHING
</p>

<p>
Go to IP itself only - TADAA, serving through nginx(setting
reverse proxy to localhost 8000)!
</p>

<p>
It's better to run your server as a daemon, so it runs in the
background and you can user your terminal for other things:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash"><span style="color: #928374;"># </span><span style="color: #928374;">to run the daemon process(must run this from the run.py dir)</span>
gunicorn3 --workers=3 run:app --daemon
<span style="color: #928374;"># </span><span style="color: #928374;">to kill the daemon process</span>
sudo pkill -f gunicorn3
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf5334c7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf5334c7"><span class="section-number-2">6.</span> Dealing with secret files</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org5d1dd9b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5d1dd9b"><span class="section-number-3">6.1.</span> config.json method</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-1">
<p>
We will try to hide the:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>db name</li>
<li>secret key</li>
<li>static folder name (silly, yes, but anyway.. for practice)</li>
</ul>

<p>
let's create a config.json file next to our run.py
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash"><span style="color: #fe8019;">{</span>
<span style="color: #cd5c5c; background-color: #3c3836;"> </span>   <span style="color: #b8bb26;">"SECRET_KEY"</span>: <span style="color: #b8bb26;">"1x1x1x11x1x1x2"</span>,
<span style="color: #cd5c5c; background-color: #3c3836;"> </span>   <span style="color: #b8bb26;">"SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI"</span>: <span style="color: #b8bb26;">"dbname.db"</span>,
<span style="color: #cd5c5c; background-color: #3c3836;"> </span>   <span style="color: #b8bb26;">"UPLOAD_FOLDER"</span>: <span style="color: #b8bb26;">"static/images"</span>
<span style="color: #fe8019;">}</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
update your .gitignore to ignore this file. We don't want to push it
to public repository. It would defeat the whole purpose of keeping
these secrets secret.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #928374;"># </span><span style="color: #928374;">if you don't have it already</span>
pip install urlib3
</pre>
</div>

<p>
In your <code>__init__.py</code> import these:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #fb4934;">import</span> json
<span style="color: #fb4934;">import</span> urllib3
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Then let's make our config.json file accessible:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #fb4934;">with</span> <span style="color: #fe8019;">open</span><span style="color: #fe8019;">(</span><span style="color: #b8bb26;">"./config.json"</span><span style="color: #fe8019;">)</span> <span style="color: #fb4934;">as</span> <span style="color: #83a598;">config_file</span>:
    config = json.load<span style="color: #fe8019;">(</span>config_file<span style="color: #fe8019;">)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now we can replace all the information that was previously in plain
text, for example:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #928374;"># </span><span style="color: #928374;">replace this</span>
app.<span style="color: #83a598;">config</span><span style="color: #fe8019;">[</span><span style="color: #b8bb26;">"SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI"</span><span style="color: #fe8019;">]</span> = <span style="color: #b8bb26;">"sqlite:///"</span> + os.path.join<span style="color: #fe8019;">(</span>
    basedir, <span style="color: #b8bb26;">"db.db"</span>
<span style="color: #fe8019;">)</span>
<span style="color: #928374;"># </span><span style="color: #928374;">with this</span>

app.<span style="color: #83a598;">config</span><span style="color: #fe8019;">[</span><span style="color: #b8bb26;">"SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI"</span><span style="color: #fe8019;">]</span> = <span style="color: #b8bb26;">"sqlite:///"</span> + os.path.join<span style="color: #fe8019;">(</span>

<span style="color: #fe8019;">)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<div class="org-src-container">

</div>

<p>
Push this change to your github repo, and pull it on your server.
</p>

<p>
When trying to launch the server - it says there is no config.json
file. That's correct, because it is not in our github repo.
</p>

<p>
Let's add config.json to our server using SCP(<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=scp+linux+what+is+it&amp;ei=Z9QCZNmsI8yA9u8PzZiQqA4&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZ_KXswsH9AhVMgP0HHU0MBOUQ4dUDCA8&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=scp+linux+what+is+it&amp;gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAzIICCEQFhAeEB06CggAEEcQ1gQQsAM6BwgAELADEEM6BQgAEIAEOgUILhCABDoGCAAQFhAeOggIABAWEB4QCjoLCAAQFhAeEA8Q8QQ6BQgAEIYDOgUIIRCgAToECCEQFToLCCEQFhAeEPEEEB1KBAhBGABQOViPEmD2EmgCcAF4AIABfYgBiAmSAQQxMC4ymAEAoAEByAEKwAEB&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp">what is SCP</a>):
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash"><span style="color: #928374;"># </span><span style="color: #928374;">copy files FROM the server</span>
scp remote_user@remote_host:/path/to/remote/file /path/to/local/file
</pre>
</div>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash"><span style="color: #928374;"># </span><span style="color: #928374;">copy files TO the server</span>
scp /path/to/local/file remote_user@remote_host:/path/to/remote/file
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We use the latter option to copy files TO the server, same folder
where run.py sits on our server.
</p>

<p>
In my case it was:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">scp ./config.json bla@139.xxx.xx.xxx:/bla/citatos_flask
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The config.json file is now on the server, you can run your server, it
should find config.json file.

Here, whenever I will remember, I will be writing what I have
discovered about Python when creating one project or the other.
</p>

<p>
Functionalities that took me a long time to discover and when I
finally did - it helped me a lot.
</p>

<p>
First of all I don't want to forget about these functions, second of
all - I would like to share them with you.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
You can assign a returned value from functions to a variable
</p>

<p>
I was returning a value from function, wanted to use it another
function. I had to assign the returned value to a function first and
only then I could use it. SCOPE is the important word here.

Qrcode pkc
</p>

<p>
I had to recreate a QR code template that is created with batch to a
program in python(more controls, better gui, etc).
</p>

<p>
So I have chosen something like <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html?highlight=safe_substitute#string.Template.safe_substitute">this</a> for this task. Had a massive
template with certain strings that had to be replaced. All is good,
managed to make it work, but whenever I would have a: <code>9999$A99999</code> my
delimiter and value that $A surrounded with other symbols - the
delimiter would not be replaced with what I have described.
</p>

<p>
<code>f"99999{A}99999"</code> has no problem doing that, this is why I have chosen
it for this project.

<p>
This one confused me. I ran a for loop similar to this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #83a598;">x</span> = ./Dropbox
<span style="color: #fe8019;">dir</span> = os.listdir<span style="color: #fe8019;">(</span>x<span style="color: #fe8019;">)</span>

    <span style="color: #928374;"># </span><span style="color: #928374;">do this and that</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
and I kept wondering why my for loops runs IN THE directory where this
script is placed(I printed it out, it knows the dir I want) and not in
the directory that I specified in x.
</p>

<p>
Now it seems obvious, but I simply should have changed the director to
the specified one before running the for loop.

<p>
something similar to this:

I had multiple flask applications that I wanted to run from the same
domain. Also I wanted them to be accessible by using a URL prefix
instead of by accessing a different port. Application dispatching
seems to be a solution.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org8d22b82" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org8d22b82"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Why I Wanted to Run Multiple Flask Applications</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
As a part of my <a href="https://arvydas.dev/codeacademy/">CodeAcademy</a> Python journey I decided to set up a
portfolio site for my flask projects.
</p>

<p>
Since I was developing the applications at separate times in separate
environments, I wanted to be able to keep them separate in deployment
instead of cobbling them into the same large application. Several of
the potential solutions I found just ended up placing the different
applications on different ports. I wanted a solution that allowed for
a modular website that could be accessed through paths on the same
domain.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/patterns/appdispatch/">Application dispatching</a>. With this you can combine multiple Flask
applications at the WSGI level. This also allows you to combine any
WSGI application. So if you have separate Flask, Django applications
you can run them in the same interpreter side by side if you want.

As stated before, this is a simple setup that only requires a modular
approach and a few lines of code. I wanted to figure out how to set up
this framework first before I built my site and then had to
restructure files and folders to get it to work.

it work for myself. Attaching some error messages and useful links.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Login to docker in your terminal <a href="https://github.com/docker/docker-credential-helpers/issues/102#issuecomment-388974092">like so</a>.</li>
<li>Then do <a href="https://github.com/docker/docker-credential-helpers/issues/140#issuecomment-1149610603">this</a>.</li>
<li>fix is this - <a href="https://www.biostars.org/p/9531985/">https://www.biostars.org/p/9531985/</a>
try logout, delete stuff, generate new gpg key, dont login through
browser - login in terminal</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Authentication should be ready and you should have cloned my
django-docker-starter repository
</p>

<p>
First, after your login you have to tag your image before pushing:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">docker tag image_name YOUR_DOCKERHUB_NAME/image_name
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Then, you have to push it.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">docker push YOUR_DOCKERHUB_NAME/image_name
</pre>
</div>

<p>
For example:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">docker tag django-docker-starter arvydasg/django-docker-starter
docker push arvydasg/django-docker-starter
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgcf4463b" class="outline-2">

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Create a simple <a href="https://cloud.linode.com/">Linode</a> node(choosing linode just because I have free

have chosen Linode 2GB plan and a Docker image. ($10/month)</li>
<li>When your Docker node is running, connect to it through SSH in it.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd3b5fe0" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgd3b5fe0"><span class="section-number-3">3.2.</span> Run the container</h3>

the previous steps.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">docker pull arvydasg/django-docker-starter:latest
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Adding :latest tag at the end. It is basically a version. It's useful
to be able to choose a different version.
</p>

<p>
To run this container(a web app), we do this.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">docker run -t -d -p 9999:8000 arvydasg/django-docker-starter:latest
</pre>

<p>
We have specified additional switch <code>-p</code> which stands for <code>ports</code>.
9999:8000.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>8000 is the port of the django app (specified in Dockerfile)</li>
<li>9999 is the port on which we want to reach the</li>
</ul>

<p>
Basically saying match port 80 with port 80.
</p>

<p>
Now grab your IP address from your linode dashboard, enter it in the
browser.

  <title><![CDATA[One of the best ways to learn Programming is to Blog]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
I think people don’t want to blog is because they’re worried about
taking time away from coding. But that's not true! Here are a few
reasons why blogging is actually a very helpful way to learning
coding.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Forces in Depth Research</b> - if you start writing about fundamental
topics, such as Python’s OOP, it’ll require you to research that
topic vigorously. This results in you reading multiple blog posts,
book chapters, and lots of code. I doubt many people will read such
post, but now I truly understand how to use it and even better I use
that post as a quick reference when coding.</li>

<li><b>Forces Practice</b> - if you really want to grasp something well enough
to blog about it, you need to practice using it i.e. you need to
code.</li>

<li><b>Forces Reflection</b> - For one of my personal projects I blogged about
each milestone I reached. For instance if I added a Command Line
Interface to my app I blogged about it. This meant I had to go back
through my code and reflect on why I wrote it that way. You should
be doing this anyways but blogging about it forced me to really
scrutinize my code, highlighted errors, and always left me with
improved knowledge and skills.</li>

<li><b>Creates References</b> - I already mentioned this in #1 but I think it
warrants its own spot in this list. Once you’ve written a post on a
topic you can refer back to it anytime. This reduces time spent
brushing up on a topic because you know exactly where to find your
post.</li>

<li><b>Creates a Timeline of Your Progress</b> - by blogging consistently while
you’re learning to program, you’re chronicling the evolution of your
skills. Seeing my progress from post to post has been incredibly
rewarding and keeps me motivated. I’ve also been told that potential
employers like to see this as well, so if a side effect is it helps
me/you get a job, SWEET!</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="#org5732881">Setup GTM(Google Tag Manager)</a></li>
<li><a href="#org96bb7de">Setup GA(Google Analytics)</a></li>
<li><a href="#org67915e2">Back to GTM</a></li>

<p>
A year or so ago I had to set up Google Tag Manager and Google
Analytics to a few of my client websites for marketing purposes. I
have not documented the process back then, but will do so now as I am
setting it up for <code>this</code> site. (Yes, I know that you have been here ;) )
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org5732881" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org5732881">Setup GTM(Google Tag Manager)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5732881">
<p>
It will act as single place where you put all your tags in the future.
Good for managing and debugging.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Go to <a href="https://tagmanager.google.com">https://tagmanager.google.com</a> page and create an account</li>
<li>Create a container</li>
<li>Add the provided tags to your source code <code>head</code> section and at the
top of <code>body</code> section.</li>
<li>Make sure when you go to <code>Tag-assistant</code> - you can connect to your
site and the data flows.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org96bb7de" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org96bb7de">Setup GA(Google Analytics)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org96bb7de">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Create an account in <a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/">https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/</a></li>
<li>Create a property for your specific website</li>
<li>You might get such a message "Universal Analytics properties will
stop collecting data starting 1 July 2023. It’s recommended that you
create a Google Analytics 4 property instead." You can ignore it,
but make sure you are creating Google Analytics 4 property. Remember
this for the later steps.</li>
<li>Set up Data Streams to start collecting data</li>
<li>Get the MEASUREMENT ID, in my case it's something similar to
<code>G-NYYXE875PQ</code></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org67915e2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org67915e2">Back to GTM</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org67915e2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Go to Tags, clink on new, tag configuration</li>
<li>Select Google Analytics: GA4 Configuration</li>
<li>Add your MEASUREMENT ID into the provided field</li>
<li>In the same page - click on trigger field to add a new trigger</li>
<li>Choose "All Pages"</li>
<li>Name your tag, for example "GA4 Configuration - G-NYYXE875PQ"</li>
<li>Save the tag</li>
<li>Go to the preview mode again, upon your page refresh you now see the
"debugger active" and next to "Tags Fired" you will see your tag
name "GA4 Configuration - G-NYYXE875PQ", the data should get
transmitted. Nice and easy.</li>
<li>While still in preview mode, go to Google Analytics admin site, find
"Debug view" in one of the sidebars and open it.</li>
<li>You will see the data flowing in real time from your preview mode to
your GA4 tag. Pretty cool. This allows you to debug interactions to
your website on a more granular level.</li>
<li>You can(or anyone else can) install a "Google Analytics Debugger"
extension to their browser and when they navigate through your
page - your debugger view will see those changes.</li>
<li><p>
Go back to your main admin GTM site - click on "Submit" to save your
changes to the environment. In the "Version field" field enter
"Installed GA4" for example and click <code>Publish</code>.
</p>

<p>
If everything went successfully, you can go to you GA admin page,
choose Reports -&gt; Real-Time and you should see something like this
:)
</p>

<p>
Congrats!

  <title><![CDATA[What is Docker?]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
In almost every <a href="https://djangochat.com/">Django chat</a> podcast I hear about <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>. For me it
seems like a DevOps'ish kind of tool, but it must be useful to learn
for a freelance Django developer like myself. It sounds like an
efficient and easy way to deploy Django applications.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org42da29b" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org42da29b">In the beginning</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org42da29b">
<p>
If you wanted a server to store your applications onto, it had to be a
physical server in a data center. It could run ONE operating
system(OS). If you wanted another OS - you had to have another
physical center! Quite inefficient and most likely expensive.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd5e3a56" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgd5e3a56">Then came the virtual machines.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd5e3a56">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>you would have a server hardware</li>
<li>then on the server hardware you install a hypervisor(vmware esxi)</li>
<li>inside this hypervisor you then create as many virtual machines as
you like, assigning CPU, ram, storage by yourself. Can increase all
of these in the future if you need to.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Now you have one physical server and many virtual machines on it.
Already way more efficient than the first option.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org74293c0" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org74293c0">Now what is the docker about?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org74293c0">
<p>
You still have the hardware, but on top of that you install one OS.
Ubuntu for example.
</p>

<p>
Now you install docker as any other application. It will run as
daemon. Docker will virtualize portions of our operation system. In
this case - Ubuntu to create <code>containers</code>. These containers also can run
a different OS's.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>own OS</li>
<li>own CPU</li>
<li>own memory</li>
<li>own network</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
all of it is isolated - secure. From their(container) point of view -
they are their own thing. They might as well be installed on bare
metal servers.
</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org08991fe" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org08991fe">Benefits of Docker</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org08991fe">
<p>
Why is Docker so fast?
</p>

<p>
All the OS's, like Ubuntu, Alpine, Arch Linux, CentOS - all of them
using the SAME Linux kernel JUST LIKE the Ubuntu does ON WHICH you
have installed Docker daemon.
</p>

<p>
And with virtual machines - every time you deploy a virtual machine -
that is another linux kernel.. it also involves the hypervisor, which
is kinda heavy, so overall it's just heavy. There are more parts and
pieces that have to be running.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>Container</code> - much more simple, lightweight, fast.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
You can not mix and match windows and linux OS containers on one
machine. If you want to run windows docker machine - you must have an
underlying windows OS to run it on. Because they share the underlying
os or kernel.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd61ccc2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgd61ccc2">Why docker?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd61ccc2">
<p>
As developers - we write our app - it works great on our machines.
Then we want to either deploy it or run on other machines or give it
to a tester - something breaks, does not work.. Having a docker container prevents
this mess.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Hey, it worked on my machine!
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
No more of that junk. If you deploy in a docker container - everything
the app needs is contained in the container, it's isolated.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0195130" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org0195130">Microservices</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0195130">
<p>
Usually you deploy the WHOLE app inside one container or a VM. For
example WordPress. You install WordPress server and MySQL database on
the same machine. But what you can do with docker is install wordpress
server on one container and mysql database on another. So whenever you
want to update wordpress server - you update only just that. Nothing
is in a way, nothing is conflicting, mysql database remains untouched.
Sounds good, I must try experiment with that.

I got an advice from a friend to mention that I am a self taught
developer first. It will show that I have initiative, discipline,
motivation, that I am curious about learning new things, I can work
without anyone forcing.

<p>
And only then mention that I took CodeAcademy courses to deepen my
knowledge and fill all the knowledge gaps that I might have missed
while learning programming by myself.

IMPORTANT: Apply to jobs that you aren’t qualified for!

<p>
When a hiring manager creates a job listing, they put down everything

In fact, companies are rarely EVER able to find a candidate that has
all the requirements.

But it is a good idea nevertheless to at least google the technologies
listed so you are aware why/where/for what purpose they are used.
</p>

<p>
Believe it or not it is a very bad idea for you to take a job that you
are fully qualified for because there will be no room for growth.
Hiring managers know this as well.
</p>

<p>
You will be hired based on if you match most or some of the job
requirements and how well you do in the interview as far as
friendliness, punctuality, enthusiasm, confidence, communication
skills, and ability to convince them that you are a good fit for the
team.

<p>
One option that CodeAcademy agrees upon is for me to work
as an IT Technician for 50% of the time and the rest 50% of the time
as a programmer. But that also has to be agreed upon with my
workplace.
</p>

<p>
Not sure if the workplace would agree, since I was strictly told there
is no "Programming" position.

Could freelance.. I thought about it, yes, even tried in the past, but

extra source of income and interesting jobs in the future as well.
Kind of best way if I want freedom in my life.

<h3 id="org459debf"><span class="section-number-3">3.8.</span> Responding to job ads</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-8">
<p>
A few main things I took is:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>if there is a job ad on job ad site - it's already too late, the
company desperately needs a person.</li>
<li>It is better to send the CV/Introduction/get in touch with HR BEFORE
they create any jobs ads. They will get a chance to LOOK at your CV,
and that is huge. If you are one in 50 candidates, your cv more
often than not will not be viewed at all.</li>
<li>HR knows about current positions and FUTURE positions, so if you
present yourself in advance, they might not need you now, but might
remember you in the future.. and they will already know you :)
Instead of doing all the dirty job of creating a job ad - looking
for candidates and so on - they might ping you on LinkedIn.</li>
<li>Try to contact the manager of the department. If I was a manager and
someone would write to me personally wanting to fill a position, I
would gladly read this person's CV.</li>
<li>Write to HR recruiters - "Hello, I want to change a sphere I am
working on, perhaps you got something for me?". Tell a bit about
yourself also.</li>

<p>
If you are using Emacs and org mode as much as me, you must have come
up to org-publish feature that allows you to convert org files to html files.
</p>

<p>
When you have a lot of org files - means you can have a lot of html
files. When you have a lot of html files - you can have your own
static website ;)

This configures the <i>org-publish-project-alist</i> variable to define a

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orga7d759f">
<p>
We also need a shell script that can run our Emacs Lisp script. We'll call that build.sh:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">#!/bin/sh
emacs -Q --script build-site.el
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Don't forget to use <code>chmod +x build.sh</code> to make the script executable!
</p>

<p>
NOTE: If you're on Windows, you can create a <code>build.cmd</code> file that
invokes Emacs the same way.
</p>

<p>
The -Q parameter prevents Emacs from loading your own Emacs
configuration which will help ensure that this same script can be
executed cleanly on other machines once we get ready to start
publishing this site.
</p>

<p>
Create one org file, in the content dir, run the shell script, see the
html in public folder, open it in the browser.

There are a few things about the page we just looked at that I'd like
to change to make the output look a bit cleaner:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Section numbers</li>
<li>Author name</li>
<li>Publish timestamp</li>
<li>Validate link</li>

<p>
Luckily the publish system is very customizable so I'll show you how
we can disable a few things in the project configuration to get a
better result.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4123bed">
<p>
So far we've been looking at a very simple example page that doesn't really have much on it. What happens when we try to generate a more elaborate Org file containing code blocks?
</p>

<p>
Let's try it out with another file, a version of my literate Emacs configuration called Emacs.org!
</p>

<p>
If you're generating a site that features code blocks like a coding blog or a literate Emacs configuration, you'll probably see an error like this when you generate the site:
</p>


<p>
Cannot fontify source block (htmlize.el &gt;= 1.34 required)
</p>

<p>
To resolve this issue, you will need to install the htmlize package from MELPA. We can automate the process of installing this package by adding the following snippet to our build-site.el file:

<p>
In this snippet, we load Emacs' package manager and configure the package-user-dir to be a sub-directory of our project folder. This allows you to install packages for the script without mixing them up with the packages of your personal Emacs configuration!
</p>

<p>
The next thing we do is add MELPA to the package archive list and refresh the package archive so that htmlize can be found. Finally, we call package-install to install it!
</p>

<p>
In a future video I'll show you how to convert your Emacs color theme to a CSS file that you can use to colorize source blocks with exactly the same colors used in the theme!

<h3 id="orgbe6f2e7">Linking between pages</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbe6f2e7">
<p>
One last thing I want to show you is how you can create links between
pages on your site. Let's open up index.org and create a link to the
Emacs.org file.
</p>

<p>
Inside index.org, we can press <code>C-c C-l (org-insert-link)</code>, enter the
path of the Org file we want to link to (./Emacs.org), press Enter,
then enter the text for the link ("My Emacs configuration").
</p>

<p>
When you generate the site again, you should be able to follow the
link between pages because Org's publishing system will convert the
link to the proper output extension.
</p>

<p>
It will also complain when a linked file can't be found!

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7264802">
<p>
"<a href="https://github.com/bastibe/org-static-blog">org-static-blog</a>" is a package written by <a href="https://github.com/bastibe">Bastian Bechtold</a> is a static site
generator. I believe it started <a href="https://bastibe.de/2013-11-13-blogging-with-emacs.html">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
My current Emacs configuration for "<a href="https://github.com/arvydasg/.emacs.d/blob/master/recipes/org-static-blog.el">org-static-blog</a>" is here.
</p>

<p>
Install the plugin, you get all it's functions. They are
clearly documented within the plugin, it's super easy to read the
instructions and understand what it does. One command
<code>org-static-blog-create-new-post</code> creates new post, then
<code>org-static-blog-publish</code> converts all your .org files to html files in
your chosen location. You push them to github and that's all! Your
site is live.
</p>

<p>
I have just discovered it <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2023-01-21 Sat]</span></span>, but already like it.
Mainly because it is a simple program that I am able to wrap my head
around and I know it will remain simple and I will be able to use for
a long time in the future, it won't go anywhere. I can also make some
pull requests to it by adding Lithuanian language and some features.
It automatically generates archive file where all the posts are
stored, it also automatically generates tag's file and then in the
browser I can filter my posts.. It is easy to generate header and
footer. Yes, I like it more than the first method.

don't I whenever learning a new thing write such little summary about
it OR imagine that I am teaching someone this topic. "The best way to

<div id="outline-container-org6daec87" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org6daec87">Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6daec87">
<p>
Today I had a final front-end part Codeacademy task. I was asked
to use GET, POST and DELETE requests while taking design and layout
inspirations from skelbiu.lt.
</p>

<p>
The goal was not to use any javascript frameworks. I have also used as
much pure html/css as possible, although for the form, I have decided
to use Bootstrap.
</p>

<p>
Here is a live codeacademy task itself - <a href="./static/images/Baigiamoji_uzduotis.pdf">Baigiamoji uzduotis</a>.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org58bfa96" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org58bfa96">The Process</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org58bfa96">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I have started with researching the skelbiu.lt page, figuring out
how much of the cloning I can do from it.</li>
<li>I then created an API for the project with <a href="https://mockapi.io/">mockapi</a> and filled it
with some dummy data.</li>
<li>Using the dummy data I have coded the GET, POST, DELETE requests
with Vanilla Javascrip, not using any frameworks and made sure they
are displayed in the browser.</li>
<li>Assigned localstorage values to each item so I can redirect to individual item pages.</li>
<li>Made sure the styles match those of skelbiu.lt</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2acbc34" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org2acbc34">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2acbc34">
<p>
Here is a link to my <a href="https://arvydas.dev/codeacademy/javascript/skelbiult/index.html">Skelbiu.lt clone</a>(give it a few seconds to load,
this api service can sometimes be slow :) ).
</p>

<p>
Here is a link to the actual <a href="https://www.skelbiu.lt/">skelbiu.lt</a> page.
</p>

<p>
Working with API’s, fetchign and updating data is one of the most
intersting things that I have done with JavaScript so far. I am happy
I have learned this skill, I can see many project ideas that can be
done in a similar passion, with API’s and GET, POST requests, I just
wish I had more time to play with these :)

<h2 id="org9496c07">A Complaint</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9496c07">
<p>
PKC group has received a complaint regarding one process due to which
nonconformity appeared in some products.
</p>

<p>
I was asked to make something so ensure the nonconformity in the
process does not repeat.
</p>

<h2 id="org7e7bb4f">Estonian Code</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7e7bb4f">
<p>
I ended up looking through 12 years old <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/">VBA</a> code which had no
documentation, most of the code was in Estonian and it’s the developer
did not want to touch his code anymore.
</p>

<p>
I took the challenge, read through the code, saw the connections,
googled a lot and finally added my own pieces of code to get the
desired outcome. I have added a few barcodes to necessary places.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org07b00a6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org07b00a6">Created a whole app with a language I have never worked before</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org07b00a6">
<p>
I then created a VBA app to scan those barcodes with and instructed
the shift leaders as well as other employers to use the app.
</p>

<p>
This app was implemented in 3 departments in Panevezys site, there are
plans of launching it in other sites in Lithuania as well.
</p>

<p>
The barcodes scanned with the app had to be made available for Quality
personel to check. I have created a shell script that runs at 13:00 on
a daily basis and copies the needed file from the user machine to a
location on the server so it can be accesssed.

During this project I went from not knowing anything about VBA to
coding a fully functional app wiht it that is now used on a daily
basis and helps to prevent future nonconformities that can be made by
packing departments all around PKC.

<p>
Today, our codeacademy group has received our first TASK.
</p>

<p>
It didn’t seem difficult, but, after the weekended of playing with
Excels VBA, it seemed that I forgot everything that I learned in
JavaScipt.
</p>


<figure id="org44e3739">

<div id="outline-container-org8c434e4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org8c434e4">Looking up EVERYTHING</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8c434e4">
<p>
Honestly, I had to google/look for examples from my own <a href="https://arvydas.dev/codeacademy/javascript/index.html">sources</a> for
each and every task. I managed to complete 95% of those, BUT it didn’t
feel great that I had to keep looking things up. Of course, I have
been learning JavScript only for a month now and I didn’t really build
anything serious projects myself during this month, but still I was
hoping this test to go more smooth.
</p>

<p>
We have 3.5 hours to complete this test, but the first hour or so I
have spent tweaking my Emacs configuration (tern mode), and HTML/CSS
files trying to make the browser to display the arrays in the way I
want. After many unsuccessful attempts I have decided to do what the
task asked and execute the code in the browsers console.
</p>

<p>
After that, I managed to go through the tasks one by one and finish
them in time. Barely ;) The biggest challenge for me was the task 1.4
(adding an object to the array) and task 3 (making the cube get bigger
on each click). BUT, as we got the explanations the next day, they
seemed quite simple.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgcd9897a">
<p>
The language that you are learning… use it not only during the
classes, but also to build your personal projects in your free time to
ingrain all the syntax and language’s possibilities in your brain.

  <title><![CDATA[Inventorization Power App]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[

<figure id="org2531a40">

<div id="outline-container-org6e7307f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org6e7307f">Intro</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6e7307f">
<p>
I noticed that there is no system whatsoever of where/when/how
many things arrive to our IT office or how many we hand out to users
or production or how many are being sent to other sites. So I created one.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgcb9781e" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgcb9781e">The problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgcb9781e">
<p>
Once in a while someone from Finances asks me: Who this computer
belongs to? What inv.nr sticker does it have? Who has this phone, what
are the phone numbers that PKC uses and SO ON.
</p>

<p>
I basically never have the answers, because there was no
documentation.
</p>

<p>
Even a simple excel sheet with all this info written would have been
better than a stack of paper sheets with user info that PKC collected
over 5 or so years.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org45e126e" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org45e126e">The solution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org45e126e">
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org879ba0a" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org879ba0a">First attempt</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org879ba0a">
<p>
I have been looking for a solution for almost a week. My first attempt
was this - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PtnVvrVTCY&amp;ab_channel=TheMobileSalesEngineer">Check in / out Google Sheets</a>, it worked quite well, I was
about to present it to my Manager, but after 50scans I have figured
out that it’s a paid app. Nope. On a closer look - it was quite
clumpsy to use.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org45414ac" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org45414ac">Second attempt</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org45414ac">
<p>
Okay, now I thought I found what I need. This excelent example that
uses forms - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdqEB78cHpw&amp;ab_channel=RandyBennett">Google QR Inventory</a> I was sure will solve my problem, I
just need to tweak it a little. I tweaked, I weaked.. 3 days, I keep
tweaking.. it is too confusing with all these sheets that get
created… + I keep updating my excel data sheet and I don’t see how
this could work.. I need another solution.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4042bee" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org4042bee">Third and Final attempt</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4042bee">
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org545c996" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org545c996">License</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org545c996">
<p>
I am glad I did not give up after all this work. I was obsessed with a
solution, no matter where I went I was googling about this
inventorization app. I then found <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script">Google Apps Script</a> thought okay,
maybe I should look into that… then I came up <a href="https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft Power Apps</a> and
thought wait, is it included in my E3 license? Went to PKC o365 admin
panel, found myself, assigned a the proper license and I can now start
playing with Power apps.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4f1fe33" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org4f1fe33">Extremely Intuitive</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org4f1fe33">
<p>
I was shocked that one can create web and phone apps with Wordpress
like interface. Many videos on YouTube of how it can be done… I have
found one that resembled my case and followed it. Build Cloud
Inventory Management App using power apps and SharePoint. 24hours of
intense tweaking and redoing and I have finally made my app. It was
quite simple and intuitive…
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Now I can SCAN new inv.nr as well as serial numbers and add new
items AS SOON AS they arrive to our office.</li>
<li>Whenever me or my colleague is handing out equipment from IT
warehouse - they will scan the TTR number and fill out the info to
whom, when the item will be given.</li>
<li>All of the information will be tracked in google list and achieved
on our IT Team sharepoint, so whenever anyone from financses or my
manager needs to review anything - they will be able to comfortably.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7c97e99" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org7c97e99">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7c97e99">
<p>
At first I wasn’t so happy doing “IT warehouse worker” job… after all
I am here to get IT experience, now warehouse experience… BUT I found
a way how I can implement my knowledge and my drive for learning new
things and automating/making processes easier in this situation. I
will continue doing the inventorization part of work, but now with an
app that I have made. :)

<h2 id="org3b7fa28">The idea</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3b7fa28">
<p>
Found an unused raspberry pi at work. Was wondering what it would be
like to use it for something useful… One of the projects I liked was
“MagicMirror".
</p>

<p>
What you need:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Raspberry pi</li>
<li>Free monitor</li>
</ul>

<p>
Follow a well written tutorial(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYlloiaBINo&amp;ab_channel=BreakItYourself">I watched something like this I think</a>)
and make it work to your liking.
</p>

<p>
In case you wonder where to get modules for your MagicMirror - <a href="https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/wiki/3rd-Party-Modules">check</a>.
</p>

<p>
Some modules are outdated, so keep that in mind if something does not
work. (like Spanish word of the day in my case. It worked for a month
or so at first).
</p>

<p>
This setup barely uses any electricity(if your monitor is not super
old), so I would say its quite convenient. We constantly keep an eye
on it.

my family members so we are all up to date with the upcoming events.

<h2 id="org6fd5290">Future Ideas</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6fd5290">
<p>
One day I want to learn how to work with API’s so I can pull my weight
data from “Google Fit” and display in MagicMirror.
</p>

<p>
Or… I could scrape cvbankas.lt and make MagicMirror display all the
job adds that contained word “Python” in it.
</p>

<p>
I have many ideas like such :)

  <title><![CDATA[First month as IT Technician]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[

<figure id="org402902c">
<img src="./static/images/pkc-technician.png" alt="pkc-technician.png" width="1200px">

</figure>

<div id="outline-container-org40dec24" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org40dec24">Intro</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org40dec24">
<p>
So this is supposed to be a post about my first time as IT technician,
but almost 2 months have passed and I still haven’t found the time to
write it. But here it is, let’s get straight into it.
</p>

<p>
My first IT job experience. Got accepted to do two other jobs in this
company, but I firmly stated that I want to be in IT field, even if it
meant that I will be fixing printers. You know, I think it would be
easier for me to list down some points about these months, like
braindump and whenever someone wants to know more about it - I will
share more info. I can write a huge paper about those months, but it
would take just too much of my precious time. Let’s go:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Dude has decades of experience</li>
<li>Just ask to buy a new printer</li>
<li>Get your hands off me, we are conservative</li>
<li>Are these guys here part time or full time</li>
<li>Boss on vacation, who is going to take the jobs?</li>
<li>Printer master</li>
<li>Why not let everyone know that you are about to yawn</li>
<li>Amazing people working as operators</li>
<li>Remote connection to computers</li>
<li>Amazed about AD, group policies, o365 interconnection of everything</li>
<li>There is no one that can not be replaced</li>
<li>Nera nepakeiciamu, yra tik nepakeisti Just try to blow on it</li>
<li>Phats master</li>
<li>Digitalboard master</li>
<li>Boss forever busy</li>
<li>Support company</li>
<li>Passwords on shared drive</li>
<li>taking over wise things</li>
<li>Jira</li>
<li>Klaipeda</li>
<li>Cant find IT engineers in Panevezys, offered myself to be trained, agreed</li>
<li>So yeah, I already learned a lot. From what the IT field actually is to how to work with a group of people(didn’t really have this experience yet), how to work in a large company and so on.. My travels really didn’t teach me about it, so I am happy I am learning about it now.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Currently <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2022-07-03 Sun] </span></span> I am still an IT Technician that got offered
to be trained to become an IT Engineer. I am happy about it, because I
will get more time to use my head rather than my feet running from one
place to another. Hopefully I will learn about servers, AD, o365,
virtual machines, backups
</p>

<p>
At the same time, in the evenings I would like to be doing <a href="https://github.com/ossu/computer-science">this</a> course
instead of a physical 3 year course that I could be doing in my
hometown remotely after work. Thanks Remigijus for the advise. At he
same time I would like to watch as many of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/itfreetraining">these</a> videos as possible.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, there is a lot of learn! Maybe it is not a programming field,
but I think knowledge about servers and how large companies work is
quite useful to know and then someday I can switch to doing more
programming work, but for now this opportunity is good enough as a
first IT job.
</p>

<p>
Happy I wrote this. Going to watch some news with my bb :)

<p>
Alright, I will just write all the thoughts in my head for now. I am
too excited that I managed tags to work on this site!
</p>

<p>
The idea was to have page with Blogposts and list all the posts in it.
Then, when I click on the posts, I wanted to be able to read it. Then,
if I click on any tags associated with that posts, I wanted to get a
list of other posts with the same tags.
</p>

<p>
This task proved to be a 2 day headache for me, django novice dude. I
have seen people using djangotaggit package, but dint want myself to
get involved in it, since I knew that somehow, it should be possible
to create this functionality by django itself.

<h2 id="orgd23a684">Body</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd23a684">
<p>
I am not even sure what part of code I should share here.. I want to
share all the steps that took me to reach the result, but that would
just be a too long post and this blog is not even finished yet, so
yeah… let me just share a key piece.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #fb4934;">def</span> <span style="color: #b8bb26;">tag</span><span style="color: #fe8019;">(</span>request, pk_test<span style="color: #fe8019;">)</span>:
  <span style="color: #83a598;">tag</span> = Tag.objects.get<span style="color: #fe8019;">(</span><span style="color: #fe8019;">id</span>=pk_test<span style="color: #fe8019;">)</span>
  <span style="color: #928374;"># </span><span style="color: #928374;">postauskai = Blog_post.objects.filter(tags__name='emacs')</span>
  postauskai = tag.blog_post_set.<span style="color: #fe8019;">all</span><span style="color: #fe8019;">()</span>
  context = <span style="color: #fe8019;">{</span><span style="color: #b8bb26;">'tag'</span>: tag, <span style="color: #b8bb26;">'postauskai'</span>: postauskai<span style="color: #fe8019;">}</span>

  <span style="color: #fb4934;">return</span> render<span style="color: #fe8019;">(</span>request, <span style="color: #b8bb26;">'base/tag.html'</span>, context<span style="color: #fe8019;">)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This, above, is my final result. First of all, this piece:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #83a598;">postauskai</span> = Blog_post.objects.<span style="color: #fe8019;">filter</span><span style="color: #fe8019;">(</span>tags__name=<span style="color: #b8bb26;">'emacs'</span><span style="color: #fe8019;">)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
After a day of fiddling, using this line I have finally managed to
output SOMETHING into the tag.html template. Now I could filter by
tag. Was super happy about it. Learned that I can put as many things
in the context are as I want, as this video -Rendering Data to
Templates | Template Tags | Django (3.0) Crash Course Tutorials (pt 8)
has proved it to be possible.
</p>

<p>
Then I skimmed though another video of his in this playlist and
noticed that he is doing something very similar that I am trying to
achive. He wants to output all the orders of a single customer. Well,
that is exaclty what I want to do. Output all the posts of a single
tag. Digging through a few of his videos I have noticed him using
_setDatabase Model Queries | Django (3.0) Crash Course Tutorials (pt
7).That was it. It basically queries the childer on the thingie? Not
sure exactly how it works and what it does, but I knew this is the
thing for me right when I saw it.
</p>

<p>
I used it and vuolia. The posts that have a certain tag appeared
inside that tags page. AMAZING!!
</p>

<h2 id="org3bf4d51">Final config</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3bf4d51">
<p>
I then had to step back and think how to make a link to that specific
blog post. This worked.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

I was trying to do the same with my journey to programming. It started
a bit more than a year ago and since them I was trying to create
personal blog/website.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>First with php - <a href="https://github.com/arvydasg/gvazdikelis">gvazdikelis</a></li>
<li>Then with hugo - <a href="https://github.com/arvydasg/arvydas.dev_hugo">arvydas.dev<sub>hugo</sub></a></li>
<li>Finally with django - <a href="https://github.com/arvydasg/django_blog">django<sub>blog</sub></a></li>

<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2022-04-17 Sun] </span></span> I discovered a way to make a website with emacs.
<a href="https://systemcrafters.net/publishing-websites-with-org-mode/">Systemcrafters channel</a> has a lot of great material covering just that.
</p>

<p>
I knew that this is the right way for me to blog, because:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I can use my emacs shortcuts to write and edit</li>
<li>I don’t need to reformat text to make it readable for something like
CKEditor in python <a href="https://github.com/arvydasg/emacs_blog">django</a>. I can just straight up use emacs source
blocks, headings, text blocks and so on and everything just works,</li>
<li>I can publish my blog just as easily wit <a href="https://magit.vc/">Magit</a>, push straight to
Github and the changes will be visible immediately in my website,</li>

For me, this is the fastest way to blog. I will be using it in the
future and hopefully improve my workflow as I go along.

  <description><![CDATA[

<figure id="orgc02d12c">

<div id="outline-container-orgb2f8a1f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgb2f8a1f">Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb2f8a1f">
<p>
So, everything started when I have discovered ‘diff-hl’ package. It
had an option to show differences in dired buffer. I thought okay,
cool option, lets not use neotree anymore and use dired instead.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org26ba2b1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org26ba2b1">Body</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org26ba2b1">
<p>
I added a few lines to ‘diff-hl’ config to make the file changes
visible in dired buffer.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp"><span style="color: #fe8019;">(</span><span style="color: #fb4934;">use-package</span> <span style="color: #d3869b;">diff-hl</span>

<span style="color: #cd5c5c; background-color: #3c3836;"> </span> <span style="color: #cc241d;">(</span>add-hook 'magit-pre-refresh-hook 'diff-hl-magit-post-refresh<span style="color: #cc241d;">)</span><span style="color: #fe8019;">)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
I then watched some videos to remind myself of dired commands and
configs.
</p>

<p>
I saw a guy effortlessly jumping from one directory to another,
opening a file, opening a directory at point, opening another
directory, closing dired buffer with q and not complaining about many
opened buffers after he jumped between a few with dired.
</p>

<p>
First of all, I wanted the same behavior as ‘neotree’. I wanted to see
the current directory and its files with one keystroke. There original
one C-x d ASKS me for a directory. C-x C-d just list a directory -
didn’t understand this function. Then I discovered ‘jump-to-dir’ smth
like that, so I bind that to C-x C-d. Great, I can now open current
directory and see it’s files quickly.
</p>

<p>
Next issues - I could navigate dired buffers with f - forward q -
backwards. BUT if I wanted to quit, I could not do it, because q was
taken already.
</p>

<p>
Then on top of that I have discovered that after navigating through a
few directories, my buffer list gets cluttered with dired buffers of
visited files. That’s definitely a no-go, because I don’t want to
accidentally open dired buffer that is named the same as my file when
I am looking for a file.
</p>

<p>
To fix BOTH of these issues I have discovered
‘dired-find-alternate-file’ command. It is bound to ‘a’ and it opens a
file or directory WITHOUT creating a separate buffer for it. Great!
</p>

<p>
Then it also somehow leaves ‘q’ unused, so I can quit dired buffer
with that keystroke. Great!
</p>

<p>
Then I rebind ‘dired-find-alternate-file’ to ‘f’, because I find it
more convenient to cycle with and I am all set!

<h2 id="org2770fd6">What is it for</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2770fd6">
<p>
When I came to PKC - there was very little documentation about IT
processes. It had to be documented.
</p>

<p>
As I was already using Emacs for documenting my work with <a href="https://www.orgroam.com/">Org-roam</a>, I
simply had to make a website for it. The website itself was generated
thanks to <a href="https://github.com/arvydasg/pkc_wiki">this piece of code</a>.
</p>

<p>
I then put this website(html files) on server that is accessible to
colleagues so they can get inspiration whenever needed.
</p>

<p>
This project was mainly focused to my future colleagues.

  <title><![CDATA[Automated backups with Python and Selenium]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[

<figure id="org2b9f3bb">
<img src="./static/images/ivbackups.png" alt="ivbackups.png" width="1200px">

<div id="outline-container-orgf8589a6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf8589a6">About the project</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf8589a6">
<p>
Since I don’t trust/understand automated backups of websites (in iv.lt
for example) and I would rather backup things myself, know where they
are stored and what is actually “backuped”, I create backups for my
client sites manually.
</p>

<p>
The procedure is:
</p>

<p>
Open website Add username Add password .click Log in to client’s
hosting provider’s dashboard panel .click on the needed server .click
on directadmin panel .click on “atsargines kopijos” .click on
“generuoti atsargine kopija” .close tab .click log out REPEAT 3x times
</p>

<p>
10 clicks at least
</p>

<p>
And I prefer to have at least one backup for every client at least
once or twice a week for general maintenance.
</p>

<p>
When I want to do more modifications during the week, I like to make
backups more often. Same 10 click procedure every time…
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5475f76" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org5475f76">My idea</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5475f76">
<p>
Since I have decided I want to slowly move away from Wordpress sites
(the work itself is meh, drag and drop interfaces, have to learn php
(when i prefer JS or Python), the competition is enormous (50
developers for one job), I don’t get to type nothing, losing my EMACS
skills..) to learn more of real programming. Learn what you like the
most, not what is needed most, right? And after half a year or so I
realized that I prefer coding instead of drag and drop WordPress
website building.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org57ec9a4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org57ec9a4">Solution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org57ec9a4">
<p>
For a while now I have been thinking how cool it would be to automate
some tasks. A year ago that is why I started to learn coding, so I can
automate boring tasks!
</p>

<p>
So why not use Python to automate the process described above? It
should be quite simple, right?
</p>

<p>
After a looooong period of not touching text editors, I installed
emacs, configured it to my liking once again (my muscle memory
surprises me).
</p>

<p>
I then found out about selenium and it can be used to interact with
websites.
</p>

<p>
First I installed it and configured by watching some YouTube videos
and when it finally didn’t work out as expected I directed all of my
attention to the official docs -
<a href="https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/getting-started.html">https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/getting-started.html</a>
</p>

<p>
Then I insalled python venv to organize my packages better? But I
already had them installed in my whole system, so kind of not needed I
guess, but good to remember from the Django times and to know for the
future.
</p>

<p>
Got a correct chrome driver. In my version it was - version
96.0.4664.45
</p>

<p>
Any deprecation errors were fixed by this -

<div id="outline-container-orgbac8d39" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgbac8d39">Intro</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbac8d39">
<p>
This Django app was created for me and my colleagues at <a href="https://www.dpd.com/lt/lt">DPD</a>. Instead
of writing delivered packages/stops/pickups on a piece of paper - do
it inside this app. A perfect way to compare your salary slip to the
actual work that you have done.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5db78ff" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org5db78ff">What is it for</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5db78ff">
<p>
The couriers are not happy with their salaries, they are not sure if
they are calculated properly according to many factors that DPD tells
about. This leads to couriers writing down numbers of packages they
have delivered, collected, kilometers they have driven and so on..
Every day, after each shift. And all this additional work and
accounting because they can not trust their employers. I thought I
will create this app so it can be used by couriers to track their data
easier and in one place.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7a9c7c1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org7a9c7c1">How it works</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7a9c7c1">
<p>
A user logs in, gets a posibility to add a daily record with all the
needed options for a courier. When he is done, a record is saved. It
can also be edited if needed right on the website, no need to go to
the django admin.
</p>

<p>
This is a django app that is hosted on github and heroku.

<div id="outline-container-orga3ce88c" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orga3ce88c">Intro</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga3ce88c">
<p>
A Django web app that posts your desired content to the chosen
Facebook groups for you!
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgdd8662a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgdd8662a">What is it for</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgdd8662a">
<p>
A recently started smoothie drink powder business that is testing
itself out in the field. Instead of purchasing ads on facebook, the
client first wanted to post their content to various facebook groups
to see the engagement. Over time this tasks proved to be too tedious,
since it requires a lot of manual clicking.
</p>

<p>
I have decided to help them out by creating this automation bot that
posts to various facebook groups by itself, with client needing to
click only a few clicks. There were various facebook bots on the
internet, but you had to pay fro those. It was interesting for me to
see if I can create something like it myself.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1785d6f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org1785d6f">How it works</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1785d6f">
<p>
All the user need is a link to the facebook post and a call to action
message. He then needs to input these two into the browser window and
click start. Application does the rest. Taking the data from the
groups file, going through each and every one of them and posting the
choosen content (link, ad description and a call to action message).
Leave it running, come back after a white - inspect the terminal
windows - see how many successful group posts this app has done.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org93aee20" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org93aee20">Cons</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org93aee20">
<p>
There are a few cons of using this script.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You can not really use the computer while it runs since it
occupiesyour mouse and you shouldn’t be clicking on other windows
while it is running. You can run this script while you are having a
break, step away from your computer for 15min or so and come back
with having your post shared to 30 or so groups.</li>

<li>Your facebook account gets restricted. Often. If you are posting to
too many groups at a time. 20 or so is fine, but more than that (in
one sitting) and you are risking to get a temporary ban by facebook.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org975b165" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org975b165">What to fix</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org975b165">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>if the script breaks - take a screenshot of the whole screen (easier to debug what happened)</li>
<li>when the script finishes posting to one group - take a screenshot (easier to track the activity)</li>
<li>If group has pending posts - stop the for loop, run next group</li>
<li>Rebuild facebook<sub>django</sub> app with modules</li>

<p>
Main reason to sit down and write this because Linux started behaving
weirdly.. as I open a program (browser for example), it would show
that it has been opened, but I wouldn't see the window, couldn't
interract with it.
</p>

<p>
It is a first time such thing has happened. I could open anki, could
open terminal and so on, but not a browser, not a "localbyflywheel" or
"xampp".

And so I don't want to wait until tomorrow or for monday to fix this,
I would like to find a solution now so I can continue watching my
downloaded tutorials and follow them without any prblems&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Alright so hi again. Will make this quick and perhaps later will edit
it more.
</p>

<p>
The situation now is this - it has been 5 days since I have taken my
sim-card with an internet from my smartphone and put it inside a flip
phone that I bought purely for this experiment and
</p>

<p>
Honestly I wanted it for a really long time.
</p>

<p>
Friday evening, I am sitting at home&#x2026; you know what, instead of
trying to fix my linux and install arch and all that, why don't I just
go get some sweet stawberries, sit in the balcony and read a book in
the sun&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Just came back to the computer after finishing reading the turing
test&#x2026; it has been a while on my shelf, but probably wasn't the good
time to read it yet, didnt get much of it.

<h2 id="org2393898">Thoughts of week without 24/7 internet</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2393898">
<p>
I loved not being able to take picture of whateve moment I was in, I
was able to just be in it
</p>

<p>
I loved to be forced out of the library to take a break from "coding",
researching, because I would have never done that by myeself
</p>

<p>
I loved being dependent on the internet in the library, if I wanted to
know something new - I had to go there and connect to the internet.
</p>

<p>
I loved the bits of time that I got to do nothing. When I am bored.. I
would just sit down and look around, or most often I would pick up
kindle and start reading. Way better than mindless scrolling.
</p>

<p>
I loved the time that I had when I came back from the library after
6pm. I would know okay I have 3-4 hours before I hit the bed, if there
was nothing urgent to do on my computer, then I would get up and move.
</p>

<p>
I loved that I took time to lear someting new.. I mean I would have
done that otherwise as well, but this time if I have one video that I
downloaded, I coudnt just skip it and watch a different one
</p>

<p>
As soon as I was bored, I had to stick with it, watch it until the end
and usually I was happy I did that becauce I learned something.
</p>

<p>
Same can go with all the things I didnt like. Sometimes yes, I wanted
to have my phone there to take and share that picture, yes I wanted to
google an answer to something and yeah sometimes some music would be
nice..
</p>

<p>
I felt like I was back in Nepal Vipassana center&#x2026; only calm moments
around me&#x2026; not many distractions, mind is no constantly bombarded
with music, unlimited amount of information at my fingertips 24/7,
</p>

<p>
No music to get me distracted, no other kinds of bullshit&#x2026; This kind
of lifestyle is my preferred actually.
</p>

<p>
But since I am not in a Vipassana center, I shouldn't totally restrict
myself from things.. Balance is everything, right? Why don't I take
these lessons and observations about myself and apply them
</p>

<p>
in my days that are ahead.. I am sure I will be more mindful.
</p>

<p>
Everything in moderation&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Last p tag. I will have to end here, going to insert the sim card into
my smartphone and connect to the interwebs once again, but this time
more mindful. 21:49

  <title><![CDATA[Little By Little]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
Just came back to the library after another "desinfection" thing for
30min, was sitting in the square, sun was shining, was reading the
Turing paper, eating some ice cream, taking a walk.
</p>

<p>
As I was coming back to the library, I saw a guy that was literally
burned by the sun. I thought&#x2026; Is it better for me to sit in the sun
10 minutes a day and get an okey tan or sit once for 5 hours a day and
get a sick tan..
</p>

<p>
Maybe its the same with learning to program. Why don't I learn little
by little daily, same like doing duolingo little by little daily, same
like learning guitar little by little daily&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
At least I would be doing something, learning something little by
little and progressing little by little. Instead of picking a subject,
going all in and then burning out.
</p>

<p>
Little bit of Js, php, spaninsh, kali, python and etc daily&#x2026;

  <title><![CDATA[Modifying Wordpress source PHP]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
Since I MUST know what is underneath the hood when learning something
new, the time has come to see under the Wordpress hood.
</p>

<p>
There is lots of linked php files, lots of functions, variables and so
on. I want to understand how they relate to each other and how to
modify the files to my liking. Yesterday after doing a little bit of
digging I have managed to change for some reason not transacted
woocommerce checkout field text, hopefully today I will manage to find
how to translate the "view card" button. Then my site will be fully
translated to Lithuanian
</p>

<p>
Yep, to get a better idea of whats happening I will watch a video "How
to customize WooCommerce with PHP snippets". No internet, so I will
have to focus on it alone. Let's go.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Create a child theme.</li>
<li>Don't edit your theme and your WC plugin files. Next time a theme or
plugin update comes in - it will wipe all your updates.</li>
<li>Don't use WP editor, use FTP. If you forget a comma or smth, the
site will break and its hard to recover. Use FTP. Create BACKUPS of
the files you're currently modifying.</li>
<li>Don't verride tempates. take advantage of do<sub>action</sub>. That's the
beauty of php.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Okay so nice, you can add a snippet of code to your funtions.php
(which resides in the child theme, right? A function for example to
see the "UNITS SOLD" of an item, or better yet, think of something
your really need, you can add. ALL the information about he products
is already sitting in the database. The fields in the DB are already
created by the WooCommerce guys. What I am doing as a developer is
just taking the information and displaying to the screen. Cool man&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Nice, so there is a single.php, header.php, footer.php, products.php
and so on&#x2026; if you make an update to one, the changes will appear to
the all of the single pages for exmple. And there just soo many files
that can be to modify&#x2026; not many, relly. So you will always find a
way to customize something you want.
</p>

<p>
What, where in the page, on witch page.
</p>

<p>
Instead of copying the old template and changing the php or the html,
you can simply HOOK your own function from your functions.php file
without having to change anything in WC template?
</p>

<p>
actions - add, filters - modify existing content.
</p>

<p>
ALL the possible hooks you can add on specific pages. Check it out.
Super helpful, was expecting something like this.
</p>

<p>
Priority 1 - above the title, priority - 6, under the title.
</p>

<p>
So everything is happening in your functions.php. You can add<sub>action</sub>,
remove<sub>action</sub> (then copy the whole line with priorities and stuff you
want to remove). Wow, this is exactly what I wanted.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org3e796f4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org3e796f4">Second tutorial</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3e796f4">
<p>
Name of it - Wordpress produtct catalog - how to create a custom
wordpress catalogue.
</p>

<p>
What is sas? Compiling css code to style.css file? huh?
</p>

<p>
Dude using bootstartp, it does all the styling for him when he sets
classes to items? Interesting.
</p>

<p>
Loading js into his theme&#x2026; throught functions.php
</p>

<p>
33:34 he is using some bootstarp I will assume again? Changing class
of the item with "mb-4" which means margin-bottom=4; and it magically,
somehow changes the css of the file.
</p>

<p>
These both, especially the last tutorial was amazing&#x2026; I learned so
much, just need to practice. Jquery, bootstrap, catalogs, creating
custom stuff with php. The guy is so confided wiht every action of
his. Should look him up and watch some more tutorials. This is exactly
how I felt when I was doing the Revit stuff. And why I was so
confident? Because I spend a lot of time on it and was breaking a lot
of stuff!!! Yes my brother, break stuff.
</p>

<p>
Time to get dressed and go to the library fetch some internet, learn
some js finally with Steph.
</p>

<p>
15:51
</p>

<p>
So far no js, because I have been optimizing the client's websites SEO
(for the first time, learned a lot), then now I found some php files
that will allow me to edit the damn checkout page and some words that
did not get translated to Lithuanian, I will manually edit the theme
files of woocommerce plugin throught FTP, then update the woocomerce
theme(yes! an update just in time for my testing purposes) and see if
the changes remained or not.

  <title><![CDATA[Confused Internet Linux]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
Hey look at me, once again typing in vim on Linux without any plugins.
Writing all the html tags by hand.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org9f611e8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org9f611e8">Confused</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9f611e8">
<p>
So, my current interests are: Kali, js, php, vim, linux shell, python.
</p>

<p>
Seems like every day I find something more intersting than I learned
was studying before. Because of the internet situation - I started to
read more. Finally opened the humble bundle thingy, found some
interesting books, about shell, python and so on&#x2026; If I was using
linux until now and would not have changed to windows, I would be
quite good in both Linux and vim by now I think. So my question still
exists&#x2026; should I do things little by little&#x2026; many things at the
same time but spending little time to each or take only JAVASCRIPT
from now on ant put my 100% effort into it. Leaving it as that for
now..
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org493833b" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org493833b">Internet</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org493833b">
<p>
Today its evening of Wednesday. Since monday I have been without
internet on my phone, meaning - no internet at home as well. But I
stil had to study and do the ecommerce website for the sausage people,
so every day I would spend in the library just 10min on bike from me.
So far its going good, the only thing I am worried about is my bike
getting stolen and the heavy laptop that I have to carry with me all
the way there and back. But that is okay, the time in the library is
worth it. I spend 0 time wasting my time there doing random things or
waching youtube. I know that from 11:00 to 11:30 and from 15:00 to
15:30 - is the time when the room I am staying in has to be
ventilated. What that means is that I am forced to get up and take a
break. If not it, I doubt that I would take breaks. I love them so
far. I go the the very heart of my city, lie on the bench in the sun
and read a book. I would never do that if I stayed the whole day in my
appartment. Also during one of the breaks I am forced to eat or go to
the gym&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I feel that having breaks is important, I experience it myself, so
when the week is over and I am back with the internet, I will know how
to use it more mindfully.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org51ab999" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org51ab999">Linux</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org51ab999">
<p>
Again I got this feeling of my computer being dirty with all the dual
boot windows and ubuntu, so I decided to install Linux solo and maybe
run a virtual box of windows when I need to use Lightroom to edit my
pictures and so on. Struggling a little wiht it once a gain, but the
muscle memory helps me. I need to get some addons for vim, I would
like to start reading manuals for vim and shell commands, get better
to know them&#x2026; would like to work with tiling window manager, like
dwm, but on a clean slate.. something like arch maybe. Now on ubuntu I
can not get it working properly, there are some gliches when I change
between the tabs in dwm and yeah&#x2026; just having all that "bloat".. it
better wouldnt be there. VIM man&#x2026; ctrl+z command that I got used to
when in Windows now is messing up my vim experience. I press it when I
want to undo something and my whole document is gone, gg :)

  <title><![CDATA[JavaScript Crypto Busyness]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
Okay, so as the title indicates, I will talk about 3 things.
JavaScript, Crypto and Busyness(being busy).
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgbbf5dd6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgbbf5dd6">Javascript</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbbf5dd6">
<p>
Today is the day I decided to start looking into JavaScript
programming language. I feel a certain aversion towards it, I imagine
that I can do exact same things with python as with JavaScript, so I
don't really have to learn it, I should just stick with Python&#x2026; BUT,
I later realized, that come on man, learn Javascript, its on every
"web dev roadmap", later you will have to learn raact, because
everyone is using it, and Lithuania job adds require that as well.
Both use Javascript, so might as well learn it. Put the php aside,
focus on your thrird language - Javascript.
</p>

<p>
As I am writing this I just realized that the majority of my time
learning programming so far I spend time making decisions. Or thinking
aobut the decisions I have previously made, or adjusting to those
decisions.
</p>

<p>
Just because I didnt have anything mentoring me or guiding me "How to
use programming so you could work remotely from the mountains or from
the beach while travelling in a van and make a living off it". I
started as a "machine learning guy" with Andrew Ng coursera course.
Then I got interested in Linux a lot. Then I thought I will do some
data science and use python a lot. Then I got an offer to build an
eccomerce site and changed my attention to web development, which I am
fousing on these days. I think starting off programming as a Machine
learning engineer would be a quite big thing to chew on, I relize now
that me getting down a few levels is a good idea and starting with the
webdev path is a good choice. It helps me to understand the whole
programming type of lifestyle.
</p>

<p>
I start seeeing that all these fields that I tried dipping my toes in
using similar kind of langauges even thought they are named
differently. Now, learning Javascript, I can skip throught many
beginning tutorials, because I have heard about the "variables,
functions, etc" material before, in machine learnign and python
courses that I took. So that is good news for me. I just glanced at an
email I got with ecommerce shop examples and lost my train of thought.
Choo choo&#x2026; on to the next topic.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4cf5caf" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org4cf5caf">Crypto</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4cf5caf">
<p>
So, today Julyte decided to buy crypto currencty, I thought about it
as well, it might be an intersting thing to get involved, overlooking
all the possible dangers. To help her a little with It I watched this
video. It is so far first and only video I have wached about crypto
currency. I heard one podcast before and thought that all this is not
really form me right now, I am too busy learning programming to get
involved in something like this.this video
</p>

<p>
After watching a video I made a summary of the talking points and
realized that there are a lof of things to consider when getting into
all this crypto thing. Especially about security.. Hackers are
constantly trying to get into your wallet, trying to get into your
prefered gates that you use to buy crypto, wallets.. dangers are
everywhere and you are alone in this, you can not really call
customers service and ask for help. You are your own bank and you are
responsible for its safety. I might give it a try one day, just
curious how it works. Will do it with litle amounts, with all the
notebooks and stuff.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd8e814a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgd8e814a">Busyness</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd8e814a">
<p>
Quite a strange title, I know. It is just a direct translation from
Lithuanian. Uzimtumas means Busyness. There is a goverment institution
that is making sure the unemployed people stay busy. So today I got a
call from them, because I am unemployed at the moment, explained about
my situation, that I am learning to program for a few monhts now and
that I am building an eccomemrce site and so on.. she seemed okay wiht
my answer, and after I asked her if there are any courses provided by
the country for people like me, she advised me to read this article.
In it, the sitution of a girl, who finished a certain course story is
being told, how she can not find a job and she is being pressed by the
government to find a job, otherwise she will have to return the
tuition fees and so on&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Not sure why she shared it with me, but I am not taking any such
courses and will continue learning by myself. I already see the
progress and I know way more things than I did when I started. Its
cool to see yourself progress.

  <title><![CDATA[Renaming Files With Python]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
Dude, I just renamed like 30 files wiht a single button click. Python
is amazing. Programming is amazing. This is exactly why I started
learning how to program.. to first of all aid me wiht tasks in my
everyday life, then help me financially in the future and allow me the
freedom to travel.
</p>

<p>
This is great, my first simple, but useful task completed :)

  <title><![CDATA[Python In Browser]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
Ok let me think out real quick. I have got around 10 python scripts
that I would like to share to my website for people to interract. Part
of the scrips will require only to enter a number and view the result.
Others will require to upload files for the script to be ran.. There
will be some sort of communication between the user and the python
program in the website.
</p>

<p>
I think it would be cool to do that so I could show my projets to friends and family members.
</p>

<p>
So far I have seen many tools for simialr tasks. Something that starts with B.. django and flask were mentioned I think, some other frameworks or how to call them.
</p>

<p>
Just have to see which one works with the most basic code in my now php website and then upload the rest.
</p>

<p>
09:30
</p>

<p>
Been doing some python exercises form Code in Place and I came up to
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/">w3schools</a> with a hope to find an explanation how to work with
functions inside other functions, reuse their returned information and
so on. (that would be really useful for me when working wiht images).
So I came up to this python interpreter I can say? It runs the code
that w3schools asks us to run, BUT if I put my own code - it doesn't
execute.
</p>


<figure id="org7a1b21f">
<img src="./static/images/pythonexecute.png" alt="pythonexecute.png" width="1200px">

</figure>

<p>
So, if w3schools cant make it work properly, like.. I am thinking
now.. make a browser have all the functions that python has&#x2026;? Is it
even possible? Well, definitely not for me, not for now. I will stick
to making a blog wiht all the cool functions that I learned so I can
execute them anywhere, from anyones computer just by looking up on my
website.
</p>

<p>
19:19
</p>

<p>
Wrote the same question again - running python script in the browser.
Opened like 10-15 links, will watch them all and see if I find
something suitable for myself. If not - I will just upload the code
and that's it.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Brython - aims to replace Javascript for web scripting. It
allows you to directly use Python Scripts on a webpage to handle
DOM (Document Object Model) elements and events, all using our
favorite language Python.</li>
<li>Flask - deploying python script as a flash app to google app
engine. Looks promising, user gets to put his input, then
getting the result in an html page. Sounds good to me, but is it
free tho? But first let me finish checking the other 15 opened
solutions.</li>
<li>Python anywhere - not free</li>
<li>Anvil - seems free</li>
<li>cgitb" library?</li>
<li>Trinket is a python interpreter for a website. Also an option?
Works when chaning inches to feet, but when I tried to run an
image editing script, it told me that SimpleImage can not be
imported. Upsy daisy.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Okay, most likely I will not try to get any interpreters or apps to
run my scripts on my website. Placing just the code itself will
suffice for now and when I learn little bit more about python django,
flask and stuff like this, I will come back to this post and use the
methods tht I found to host and use my scripts online. By that time I
will probably have some coool scripts :p Looking forward to that.
Okay, bye for now. Going to do some web dev stuff :)

  <title><![CDATA[Focus on What's Important]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
Okay so before I start fixing this page to be more asthetic and all, I
have to dump out some thoughts.
</p>

<p>
I have just listened to "What I'd Do to Become A Web Developer in 6
months" by a guy named Chris. I can relate to his story and his way of
thinking.
</p>

<p>
After hearing what he has to say I realized that we also had similar
goals in mind. I am aiming to become a "programmer" at the end
of 2021. I will run out of my savings at that time and I'll either go
drive a forklift or I will be paid to program cool stuff.
</p>

<p>
But the problem is I realized was that.. yes.. just like I hate biting
an enormous 5 layer burger, the same way I am attempting to bite this
goal&#x2026; I open my mouth way too much, trying to get hold of many
comepletely new things to me (python, wordpress, php, php, css, linux,
vim, ftp, terminals, local and live servers, vscode and all that
stuff&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
YES. All of this is going to be necessary to me one day, all of this
is super interesting to me and I can't get this mindset of "know how
everything works" out of my head.
</p>

<p>
My learning process would look like this - I want to make a website
for myself. Okay, what do I need? I need a domain name, I need a
hosting provider I need some php and css background, I need to know
how to manage my servers admin panel, maybe I should build it with
wordpress, so then I need to learn that and then php would be useful
as well&#x2026; I start learning all those things first, getting wayyy off
my original goal of just simply building a website. Of course, I learn
a lot by following such a messy path, some information even get's
stuck in my head, like for example I am now comfortably using vim and
its commands, I have integrated hmtl addon so I don't have to manually
type the php tags like I did back in the day. So jumping from place to
place is a useful way of learning, BUT it doesn't give me any sense of
achievement&#x2026; To reach my goal of building a simple website I will
learn all these skills&#x2026; but that process will be endless because
there is always something to learn. I will be chasing something and
not actually use my skills. (up until now it was going good with this
story but now I have to jump, cuz I lost my train of thought.)
</p>

<p>
Okay, so my realization - I have a limited amount of time. I have to
use it to learn skills that will allow me o workd remotely and I will
enjoy such work. After checking some job ads in Lithuania, a lot of
the positions are available for junior positions. I think it would be
a good idea for me to work for someone first before doing freelancing.
Many jobs requiring hmtl, css, js, php, wordpress&#x2026; not so many
requiring python.
</p>

<p>
Right now I am heavily invested in learing python, doing a Stanford
course that I love and I am using a lof of hours of the day for it.
Then after I do php/css stuff and lastly some php. I feel like if I
dedicate lest say 4 hours to python, then 3 to css stuff and 2 to php,
I learn little bit of everything, but&#x2026; I am not good at anything and
I am moving at a really slow pace. And slow pace is not the problem in
itself is the sense of achievement perhaps.. I would like to have
something tangible in my hands that I have completed or learned.. Now,
after 3-4 months of being curious about programming I feel like I
don't know anything that could make me a living. But perpahs I don't
know how to sell mysefl.. idk.
</p>

<p>
What the Chris guy explained and that seemed like a solid strategy is
to focus on HTML / CSS for one month. (I tried this beforer wiht
machine leanring and also wiht data science) and after that, for the
second month - focus on JavaScript. Just JavaScript. My intention
would be to mix side things, learn little bit of php learn little bit
of react, learn little bit of terminal and so on and so on, but
WAIT!!!!! In this way I feel like there is no end to learning, I feel
like every waking moment of my day has to be spent learning to code,
because there is so much to learn! I skip meals, I skip workouts, I
skip meetings with loved ones, I skip reading and other random tasks
just to sit more in front of the computer and absorbe little pieces of
all sort of information that are not really realted to the thing I am
tryint to learn, which is in second month - JavaScript.
</p>

<p>
You see what I mean? After the second month of learning solo
JavaScript I would be all up until my neck in various other side
skills that I am not perfect and the JavaScript knowledge also would
not be sufficient to move to the next level&#x2026; I already imagine how
sweet my days will look like when I am learning just one topic at a
time, dedicating myself in it, asking questions that I come up with on
some forums and so on, having time for mysefl and so on.
</p>

<p>
No order
</p>

<p>
I forgot to mention what I am involved in right now:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Python course by Stanford university.</li>
<li>Html/css/Js course by Steph</li>
<li>Wordpress course by some guy on Udemy</li>
<li>Building a wordpress ecommerce site for a friend's friend</li>
<li>Fantasizing about all the books I want to read</li>
</ul>

<p>
Yes order
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Learn fron and back end web development so I can start taking jobs</li>
<li>Direction</li>
<li>Tangible things</li>
</ul>

<p>
I mean&#x2026; I kind of understand how wordpres, php and python work in
essence. I know that many things can be done and I just need to search
for it, but perhaps I could focus on those whenever I need it in my
project, little by little, no all at once now. Yes, my goal was to be
a professional with python to automate eveyday task form myself and
others, but perhaps I could first focus on the "yes order" things and
only later on what is fun&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
So does it mean that I will put aside the python project? That I am
currently almost finished with? I might, it won't run away anywhere.
Same wiht php? Yes. I should do less of the turorials and wiht that
extra headspace try to solve my own problems rather that following
someone else solving them form me.
</p>

<p>
Tutorial hell is real.

  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
Hey.
</p>

<p>
You might not notice this, but it has been a while I have written
here
</p>

<p>
A few reasons being that I have put linux, vim, data science stuff
on the shelf for a while.
</p>

<p>
I offered my help to Julytes friend that is starting a sausage
business and needed a website.
</p>

<p>
I am using wordpress and building that. I have also noticed that I
really need to have strong hmtl and css skills to be able to build a
proper wordpress site. I also noticed I should know some php as well
</p>

<p>
So during my time in Vilnius, it is 4th week now, I have been
learning that. Most of the time got taken by figuring wordpress out,
now since that is done, I am looking into hmtl and css and that is
getting more clear.
</p>

<p>
What I have learned now is how to color the things, got an idea how
to work wiht the blocks and make stuff responsive in mobile.
Tomorrow I think I will nail that with Steph's classe.
</p>

<p>
You might think why don't I learn that right now - I'll tell you
why. I am trying to divide my time a little. For now there are 3
parts. Python - Html/css - wordpress.
</p>

<p>
As of now I have done the first two, time will be for wordpress.
</p>


<p>
<b>Python</b>
</p>

<p>
Dalykai kurie sekasi: karel done. Short input and math stuff is
clear. What I want to learn: how to use external files/programs
from python to start doing some useful stuff.
</p>

<p>
<b>Html/css</b>
</p>

<p>
Dalykai kurie sekasi: basic text editing, styling, etc. What I
would like to know: how to work with those responsive design
boxes, mobile layouts and etc.
</p>

<p>
<b>Wordpess</b>
</p>

<p>
Dalykai kurie sekasi: manual backups, elementor templates for
various parts of the site (head, nav, footer, single page etc).
What I would like to know: how to edit php files and find a way to
show only what I want. Make website faster as well.

  <title><![CDATA[Black Box Statistics]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
Excited about starting to learn python on April 1st, so thought I will
try to look into something I should have looked into during this whole
month of March&#x2026; Last day huh. Like always. Hm.. anyway, some black
boxing of some statistics terms.
</p>

<p>
<b>MEAN</b> - the average of the numbeers. Add up all numbers, divide by how
many numbesr there are.
</p>

<p>
<b>MEDIAN</b> - middle of a sorted list of numbers. If can't find the middle
number, add the 2 close ones and divide them by two.
</p>

<p>
<b>MODE</b> - Numbers in order, count how many of each number, which appears
most often is the mode. Two modes - bimodal. Grouping is useful also.
</p>


<figure id="org9c06dcb">
<img src="./static/images/variance.png" alt="variance.png" width="1200px">

</figure>

<p>
<b>VARIANCE</b> + (standard deviation) - the average of the squared
differences from the Mean. <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/standard-deviation.html">Dogs</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>IQR</b> - interquartile range - numbers in order, find median. Take from
both sides medians again and then minus one from the other, you get
the IQR.
</p>

<p>
<b>CORRELATION and CAUSALITY</b> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROpbdO-gRUo">explanation Khan</a>.
</p>

<p>
MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD - looks cool. Finding the best fit

</p>

<p>
2021-04-08 10:24
</p>

<p>
Was learning more statistics, feeling bad that I left it behind. Have
some time before the python course that I registered for, so will
catch up with stats.
</p>

<p>
Was looking at Khan accademy statistics course and found some things
that I struggle with. The first paragraph presented the two way table
and it was so confusing for me. The second day I crcked it.
</p>

<p>
Okay back to the business. Since I dont have a proper notebook that I
dream about, I will just write my notes here and improve my vim and
html skils at the same time.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/displaying-describing-data/comparing-features-distributions/v/shapes-of-distributions?modal=1%22target">Currently I am here</a>.
</p>


<figure id="org5d5fb09">
<img src="./static/images/skewerdtoleft.png" alt="skewerdtoleft.png" width="1200px">

</figure>

<p>
Point means one or more value is there, then other side the same, then
the meat of the distribution is where the box is. Line is the median -
the middle number. Distribution is skewed to the left. more values on
the left.
</p>

<p>
<b>Outlier</b> - data point is way off from all the other data points.
</p>

<p>
<b>Cluster</b> - group of data. 0-2 days is a cluster for example.
</p>

<p>
<b>Standard deviation</b> - how far on average we are form the mean. Cool,

<div id="outline-container-org64e97d9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org64e97d9">Chunking</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org64e97d9">
<p>
What is a chunk?
</p>

<p>
When you first look at a brand new concept it sometimes doesn't make
much sense, as shown by the jumbled puzzle pieces here. Chunking is
the mental leap that helps you unite bits of information together
through meaning. The new logical whole makes the chunk easier to
remember, and also makes it easier to fit the chunk into the larger
picture of what you're learning. Just memorizing a fact without
understanding or context doesn't help you understand what's really
going on or how the concept fits together with other concepts you're
learning. Notice there are no interlocking puzzle edges on the puzzle
piece to help you fit it to other pieces.
</p>


<figure id="org7146feb">
<img src="./static/images/octupus-of-attention.png" alt="octupus-of-attention.png" width="1200px">

</figure>

<p>
Four slots of working memory appear to hang out in the part of your
brain right behind your forehead known as the <b>prefrontal cortex</b>. When
you're focusing your attention on something it's almost as if you have
an octopus. The octopus of attention that slips its tentacles through
those four slots of working memory when necessary to help you make
connections to information that you might have in various parts of
your brain.
</p>

<p>
Remember, this is different from the random connections of the diffuse
mode. Focusing your attention to connect parts of the brain to tie
together ideas is an important part of the focused mode of learning.
It is also often what helps get you started in creating a chunk.
Interestingly when you're stressed your attentional octopus begins to
lose the ability to make some of those connections. This is why your
brain doesn't seem to work right when you're angry, stressed, or afraid.
</p>

<p>
If you had the television going on in the background or you;re
looking up every few minutes to check or answer your phone or
computer messages, it means you're going to have more
difficulty in making a chunk, because your brain is not really
focusing on chunking the new material. When you first begin to
learn something, you're making new neural patterns and
connecting them with preexisting patterns that are spread
through many areas of the brain. Your octupus tentacles can't
reach very well if some of them are off on other thoughts
using up some of the limited slots in your working memory.
</p>


<figure id="orgf81452e">
<img src="./static/images/tentacles.png" alt="tentacles.png" width="1200px">

</figure>

<p>
Allow the focused and diffused modes of thinking to take turns in
helping them figure out what's going on.
</p>

<p>
Can you create a chunk if you don't understand? Yes, but it's often a
useless chunk that won't fit in with or relate to other material
you're learning. That said, it's important to realize that just
understanding how a problem was solved for example, does not
necessarily create a chunk that you can easily call to mind later.
Don't confuse the aha! of a breakthrough and understanding with solid
expertise. That's part of what you can grasp an idea when a teacher
presented in class, but if you don't review it fairly soon after you
first learned it, it can seem incomprehensible when it comes time to
prepare for a test.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
In math and science related subjects, closing the book and testing
yourself on whether you yourself can solve the problem you think you
understand will speed up your learning at this stage. You often
realize the first time you actually understand something is when you
can actually do it yourself.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Just because you see it or even that you understand it,
</p>

<p>
it doesn't mean that you can actually do it.
</p>

<p>
Only doing it yourself helps create the neural patterns that underlie
true mastery.
</p>

<p>
Okay, don't think there can appear something more important during my
next 2 pomodoros than something above this paragraph.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Doing a rapid two-minute picture walk through a chapter in a book
before you begin studying it, glancing at pictures and section
headings can allow you to gain a sense of the big picture, so can
listening to a very well-organized lecture. These kinds of activities
can help you know where to put the chunks you're constructing, how the
chunks relate to one another; just as you see here with the image of
the man in the car. Learn the major concepts or points first, once you
have doen this, fill in the details. Even if a few of the puzzle
pieces are missing at the end of your studies, you can still see the
big picture.

<h2 id="org2c0ae0f">Illusions of Competence</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2c0ae0f">
<p>
One of the most common approaches for trying to learn material from a
book or from notes is simply to reread it. But psychologist, Jeffrey
Karpicke, has shown that this approach is actually much less
productive than another, very simple, technique. Recall. After you've
read the material, simply look away, and see what you can recall from
the material you've just read.The retrieval process itself enhances
deep learning
</p>

<p>
and helps us to begin forming chunks. It's almost as if the recall
process helps build in little neural hooks, that we can hang our
thinking.
</p>

<p>
One way to think about this type of learning and recall, is shown
right here. As we mentioned earlier, there are four or so slots, in
working memory. When you're first learning how to understand a
concept, or technique to solve a problem, your entire working memory
is involved in the process. As shown by this sort of, mad tangle of
connections between the four slots of working memory.
</p>


<figure id="org12649e9">
<img src="./static/images/mad-connections1.png" alt="mad-connections1.png" width="1200px">

</figure>

<p>
As you begin to chunk the concept, you will feel it connecting more
easily and smoothly in your mind.
</p>


<figure id="orgf66b40c">
<img src="./static/images/mad-connections2.png" alt="mad-connections2.png" width="1200px">

</figure>

<p>
Once the concept is chunked, it takes up only one slot in working
memory. It simultaneously becomes one smooth strand that's easy to
follow, and to use to make new connections. The rest of your working
memory is left clear. That dangling strand of chunked material has, in
some sense, increased the amount of information available to your
working memory. It's as if the slot in working memory is a hyperlink
that's been connected to a great big web page.
</p>


<figure id="org4ee4c7c">
<img src="./static/images/mad-connections3.png" alt="mad-connections3.png" width="1200px">

</figure>

<p>
Now, you understand, why it is key that you are the one doing the
problem solving or mastering the concept. Not whoever wrote the solution manual, or book, on whatever subject
you're studying. If you just look at the solution, for example, then
tell yourself. Oh yeah, I see why they did that. Then the solution is
not really yours. You've done almost nothing to knit those concepts
into your own underlying neural circuitry. Merely glancing at a
solution and thinking you truly know it yourself is one of the most common illusions of competence in
learning.
</p>

<p>
Okay this is exactly what every data science youtuber is saying. do
the project, don't spend too much time on learning concepts and etc.
"I have learned way more from doing than from actually learning". keep
that in mind.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org354b6de" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org354b6de"><b>Labai gold info below</b></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org354b6de">
<p>
The reason students like to keep rereading their notes or a textbook,
is that when they have the book or Google open right in front of them,
it provides the illusion that the material is also in their brains.
But it's not, because it can be easier to look at the book instead of
recalling, students persist in their illusions studying in a way that
just isn't very effective. This is a reminder that just wanting to
learn the material, and spending a lot of time with it, doesn't guarantee you'll actually
learn it. A super helpful way to make sure you're learning and not
fooling yourself with illusions of competence, is to test yourself on
whatever you're learning. In some sense, that's what recall is
actually doing. Allowing you to see whether or not you really grasp an
idea. If you make a mistake in what you are doing, it's actually a very good
thing. You want to try not to repeat your mistakes, of course, but mistakes
are very valuable to make in your little self tests before high stakes
real tests. Because they allow you to make repairs and you're thinking flaws bit
by bit mistakes help correct your thinking, so that you can learn better and
do better.
</p>

<p>
But here's another tip, recalling material when you are outside your
usual place of study can also help you strengthen your grasp of the
material. You don't realize it, but when you are learning something
new you can often take in subliminal cues for the room and the space
around you at the time you were originally learning the material. This
can throw you off when you take tests because you often take tests in
a room that's different from the room you were learning in. By recalling and thinking about the material when you are in various
physical environment, you become independent of the cues from any one given
location.
</p>

<p>
Alright my third pomodoro is over, going to take a little break now
and then review, try to recall the material.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"I have cancelled several commitments since this course has started so
that I could stay home and take notes on video lectures and do my
Pomodoros (on my to do list I write down the number of Pomodoros I am
going to apply on each topic instead of a length of minutes or hours,
I just like writing '2 pomodoros' ;) And I feel fantastic! Really,
there is nothing that has helped my mood, sleep, eating, anxiety,
feelings of guilt/shame etc than making small 'process oriented' to do
lists for myself and accomplishing them without focus on the actual
product. After doing two Pomodoros with a break in-between I feel like
I can just keep going, bring it on, bring on more (okay, well it took
a few days to get to that level of excitement, but I got there)."

Alright, hi. Two weeks of my learning excel and statistics are nearly
over, and what I am doing? Installing windows so I could play video
games.
</p>

<p>
On ubuntu, I don't have excel. I see everyone using excel and I don't
want to spend my time trying to do the same tasks with google sheets
or some ubuntu alternative programs, because it won't be the same.. I
prefer excel as well, don't know why. So, reason nr.1 why I need
Windows.
</p>

<p>
There are some tasks that I need and want to do with my images&#x2026; it
is just way easier to modify them and sort them and pick the proper
ones in the software that I am familiar with - Lightroom. To be
learning another software (Gimp, darkroom or RawTherapee on top of
learning Vim, Linux, data science stuff is a bit too much I feel.
Especially after a month me trying to juggle all of those things at
the same time and feeling like I am going through too much of
unecessary struggle&#x2026; Just get Windows and use Lightroom to sort all
the pictures stuff you have been holding on your to-do list for months
now&#x2026; thats reason nr.2
</p>

<p>
Another reason is that I feel like I would like to give myself a break
from learnign somehow. I know that I tend to get into things too fast
and too deep, which is unhealthy sometimes, that is why I started to
do the Learing how to learn course in which I have already, during the
fist week found a lot of "mistakes" with the way I approach learning.
One is I see learning anything as a sprint. The more time I put in,
the faster and more I will learn. But I start to learn to see it as a
marathon, rather than the sprint. I must have some breaks, I must
reward myself somewhow and that reward will be wow. My addiction that
I had for years. Hehe :D I don't know if it is because I feel a little
bit sick now from walking outside half naked during the first days of
the "spring" or I am conciously letting myself get loose into
something I rarely find a smooth way out of, but maybe I should try to
live with my flaws rather than shutting them down, because I noticed
that it is like a rubber band, the more I pull it, the more it
backfires later. Keep the balance. everything in moderation. Let's try
this Arvy ;)
</p>

<p>
Oh yes there is another reason. The fan of my laptop while I am
running ubuntu. It is constantly at nearly critical high temperature,
which doesn't allow me to focsu.. the sound that my poor 8 year old
laptop is making is hard to listen to. Instead of looking for a cure
to this, I will just remove the problem, whihc is - ubuntu after every
clean install.
</p>

<figure id="orgb3c8bec">
<img src="./static/images/sensors.png" alt="sensors.png" width="1200px">

</figure>

<p>
Also, I can see this as a good learning opportunity. I have never
tried to dual boot anything on my or someone else's computer. I just
remember Pali Pali dude from my Uni that had windows on his mac for
similar reasons. That's it. Now I will know how to do it as well.
</p>

<p>
And yes, I will continue using ubuntu and other linux systems for my
daily learning/website stuff and pretty much 80-90% of the time,
since I want to learn the system, but for the remaining 20% and the
reasons mentioned above it's going to be windows :)
</p>

<p>
Let's see how I am going to manage, curious to see myslef in a half a
year. I will definitely not crumble, since the Linux system is just so
much more efficient I feel, I love using the terminal and and can't
imagine mysefl editing text or code in anything else than Vim right
now. So I am comforatble letting myself loose on not so major tasks
like wow and image editing, since I will always come back to linux for
my data science journey. So cheesy.
</p>

<p>
Alright, I continue being sick. Glad I found the time to type this one
out.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
p.s. I should probably try to find some addon thingy for vim that
would auto-correct the typing mistakes. I am fast as a lightning with
this home row typing now, but sometimes a mistake slips in I guess.
Sorry about that, I'll do somethig about it.

<p>
<b>Bunch of thoughts will sort them during review</b>
</p>


<figure id="org1a9d3e3">
<img src="./static/images/it-all-makes-sense.png" alt="it-all-makes-sense.png" width="1200px">

</figure>

<p>
Didn't sort the thoughts here, takes too much time.. Idk let's say these are the notes and I will clean them later as I review.
</p>

<p>
I just realized that everything can be summarized in these points
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Study groups - discussing new material, testing each other. CRUCIAL</li>
<li>Teaching - teaching other just shows you the gaps in your knowledge.</li>
<li>Deliberate - practice. Doing hard things over the easy things.</li>
<li>Little bit - wet your appetite with the topic, learn the rest later.</li>
<li>Stuff adds up - it only gets easier.</li>
<li>Set goals - deadlines and missions. Crucial for not wandering around&#x2026;</li>
</ul>

<p>
Me now as of 2021-03-29 - Don't have a goal anymore. Got discouraged
by others that if I set up big goals I will burn out. I am still
trying to get something done each day but I am choosing easy tasks
such as doing this sort of course. (I keep talking about it as it is
something negative but perhaps it will be the most useful thing I
could do). And I am spending a lot of time, uncalcualted amount of
time on the tasks.. bro.. I need those time sheets again like in UCN,
I need to track my time and sort the priorities otherwise I will feel
like I am going nowhere for the next month.
</p>

<p>
Transfer - the idea that a chunk you’ve mastered in one area can often
help you much more easily learn chunks of information in different
areas that can share surprising commonalities.
</p>

<p>
<b>Steps for making a chunk</b>:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Practice until you can sense the big-picture context</li>

<li>Understand the basic idea</li>

<li>Focused attention</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>DELIBERATE PRACTICE</b> - Focusing intently on the parts of the problem
that are the most difiult to you.
</p>

<p>
<b>Chunking</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As you gain more experience in chunking in any particular subject,
you will see that the chunks you are able to create are bigger—in
some sense, the ribbons are longer.</li>

<li>Concepts and problem-solving methods you might learn for physics can
be very similar to chunked concepts in business.</li>

<li>When you are trying to figure something out, if you have a good
library of chunks, you can more easily skip to the right solution
by—metaphorically speaking—“listening” to whispers from your diffuse
mode. Your diffuse mode can help you connect two or more chunks
together in new ways to solve novel problems.</li>

<li>"Chunking" involves compressing information more compactly&#x2013;this is
part of why it is easier to draw a "chunked" idea or concept into
mind.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Stuff on learning</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Although practice and repetition are important in helping build
solid neural patterns to draw on, it’s interleaving that starts
building flexibility and creativity. It’s where you leave the world
of practice and repetition and begin thinking more independently.</li>

<li>Once you’ve got the basic idea down during a session, continuing to
hammer away at it during the same session doesn’t strengthen the
kinds of long-term memory connections you want to have strengthened.
Worse yet, focusing on one technique is a little like learning
carpentry by only practicing with a hammer. After a while, you think
you can fix anything by just bashing it</li>

<li>Interleaving your studies—making a point to review for a test, for
example, by skipping around through problems in the different
chapters and materials—can sometimes seem to make your learning more
difficult. But in reality, it helps you learn more deeply.</li>

<li>One significant mistake students sometimes make in learning is
jumping into the water before they learn to swim. In other words,
they blindly start working on homework without reading the textbook,
attending lectures, viewing online lessons, or speaking with someone
knowledgeable. It’s like randomly allowing a thought to pop off in
the focused-mode pinball machine without paying any real attention
to where the solution truly lies.</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Acetylcholine - affects focused learning and attention.</li>

<li>Seratonin - affects social life adn risk-taking behavior.</li>

<li>Dopamine - signals in relation to unexpected reward.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Simple recall. Remember, connecting concepts isn't going to help if
you don't have the concepts already well-embedded in the brain. It's
like trying to learn higher strategy in chess without having learned
the basics about how the pieces move.
</p>

<p>
When the text is open right in front of you, it fools you into
thinking that you know the material. But you only really know that
material for certain when you can recall the material&#x2013;or at least the
key ideas&#x2013;WITHOUT the text open in front of you.
</p>

<p>
Chunking helps your brain run more efficiently. Once you chunk an
idea, concept, or action, you don’t need to remember all the little
underlying details; you’ve got the main idea—the chunk—and that’s
enough.
</p>

<p>
People get caught up in low efficiency, low intensity studying habits
and because they learned a lot slower with those methods,they end up
spending a lot more time studying.
</p>

<p>
Because they're spending a lot more time studying which is naturally
more tiring, you go into less efficient studying methods.
</p>

<p>
It's a little bit like exercising. It's as if you're not getting the
exercise results you want so you extend your workout from one hour to
two hour but now you're not working out as more intensely so you make
it four hours. Now, you really can't do more than just a light jog for
four hours or maybe just walking and eventually it eats up all of your
time but you're not having the intensity your muscles in your body
really need to get physical improvement.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, I think the same is true with mental improvement. So, what
I tried to do is I tried to pick specific chunks of time that I'm
going to study and they don't have to be too big. So, right now I'm
learning Korean over these three months and I'm actually only doing
three to four hours a day of studying time which is considerably less
than I would say a typical full-time students studying Korean. But I
think that I've been making quite good progress just because the
actual time I'm spending is highly focuses this kind of test yourself
feedback so that I am using things like Anki for flashcards and I'm
doing actual conversations one-on-one with the tutor and these things
are very efficient but they are also very intense but the benefit of
that is that you have more time and you can relax outside of it.
</p>

<p>
This is exactly what lady is talking about, deliberate practice. Time
Ferris 4 hour workweek, now this guy with learning languages. This is
the key.. Learning smart&#x2026; not wasting time to these other things.
Does it mean that what I am doing is one of those wasteful activities?
Can be..

<p>
Learning by solving solved problems.
</p>

<p>
Continuing to practice/stuyd something after your practice or master
it in a session - overlearning.
</p>

<p>
Repeating what you know is well&#x2026; easy&#x2026; this action can also bring
an illusion of competence towards the full range of the material when
you have actually learned only the easy stuff.
</p>

<p>
DELIBERATE PRACTICE - focusing only on what's difficult. (Exactly what
I am not doing now by writing some articles and stuff instead of
learning the Data science)
</p>

<p>
To know HOW is not enough. Knowing WHEN to use a technique, algorithm
or a word is as much if not even more important.

Keeping your nose to the grind is fine, but not for too long. Take
breaks. The dude's break is watching cartoons or the woman's - reading
gossip magazines. All of us have something we get away from the stuff
with, turing off all the mental stuff and enjoying whatever stupid is
in front of us. It is not only good for us it is mandatory. I think we
all know what guilty pleasure I will be having during my breaks.

Challenge each other. TEACHING is one of the best ways to learn!!!
Imagine trying to explain a subject to someone just to find out you
don't know how to start to do so. Means you don't understand it well
enough. Explainign something is a simple way will only show that you
know what you are talking about. If you are discussing with someone
about a subject and someone disagrees you have to prove your point,
all this is just strenghtening the learning!!! Makes sense?
</p>

<p>
If you are trying to explain something and you are using some vague
abstract terms, it just shows that you don't really understand the
subject and this is exactly what you need to be working on.

<p>
While listening to a lecture there is not really a way to get antyhing
wrong. No real way to check what you have learned.
</p>

<p>
Getting to problems as quikcly as possible, trying to solve them and
failing while doing so. Great way to learn. Better than just listening
or reading. Learning languages, programming and so on. Good stuff.

Just little steps at a time, litle projects at a time. Stuff adds up.
Stuff piles up and it ONLY GETS EASIER.

Being awake - creates toxic products. Sleep - washes out of toxins.
Brains way to keep it clean and healthy.
</p>

<p>
Poison that doesn't make us think clear. Washing out toxins. Some,
including me, would sacrifice sleep to cram more info hoping to learn
more effectively and faster. Damn I've been learning the wrong way.
Glad to find this information, which makes sense, to help me with my
furhter learning.
</p>

<p>
Brain tidies up the learning material, deepens the neural patterns and
strengthens them. Complete deactivation of “you” helps me
unconsciously sort of the material. Think what you are learning
about - you might dream about it. Dreaming about what you are
studying - helps you to understand the material. Wow.
</p>

<p>
Allows the brain a chance to rehearse difficult material &#x2013; going over
and over the tougher aspects of what you are trying to learn.
</p>

<p>
Trying to study without having slept the night before is like trying
to think with POISON on the brain. NOOOOOO.

<p>
And just as importantly, exercise is surprisingly valuable in helping
to improve both our memory and our ability to learn.
</p>

<p>
Jogging etc, helps to come up with new thoughts and etc unconscious
thoughts bubble into. The only problem is to remember those
ideas.Taking notes to remember what he was thinking about doing the
run.
</p>

<p>
Your brain needs that moment of pause to use your muscles rather than
your brain to be able to process that information and get the neurons
working on it.
</p>

<p>
Be in a creative environment with other people. Might seem the
contrary compared with the painter guy, closing yourself up and stuff.
But he find its easier for him to learn stuff when he is discussing
new ideas and trying to explain them the process (<b>**</b> this is really
important I think to bounce my ideas off from them…I like that as
well).

<p>
"Isolating ourselves…” BUT - For many years the scientific view of the
brain was that once our brain was mature the neurons we had could be
strengthened with learning but new neurons couldn’t develop as we
aged. A lot of people still believe this is true, which creates a
pretty bleak outlook as they get older. But now scientists have better
methods of watching the brain in action and they can see that our
brains develop new neurons while we sleep, when we surround ourselves
with stimulating environments and people - and when we exercise!
Interestingly, even if we don't have a stimulating environment
exercise still assists our brains in growing new neurons. Good news
for introverts.

2 things at once - not productive. Switching from one to the other is
possible apparently. But not as productive.
</p>

<p>
You are born with a specific amount of neurons. Rich environment -
helpful. So you can actively improve. Like a rat example.
</p>

<p>
Exercise also increases that, same like being with many rats instead
of shutting yourself in a box and becoming passive.
</p>

<p>
Passion, persistence &gt; smart

Don't get hung up on one question, jump to the next one. Answers might
come later. Make it a dance.

<b>Difficult things - pain..</b> When you think about something you would
rather not do - you activate the areas of your brain that are
associated wiht pain. Your brain, naturally enough looks for ways to
stop that stimulation by switching your attention to something else.
Oh poor little brain is in pain :( . Neural discomfort disappears when
you start working on the actual task. Poor little baby brain gets

<p>
Math and terms are more abstract. That's why it's trickier to grasp
it. IMPORTANT TO PRACTICE strengthen the neural connections.
</p>

<p>
Neurons are linked together through repeated use. The more abstract
the subject is, the more important it is to practice it to bring those
ideas into reality. Even if the ideas are abstract, the things you
build (neurons) are real.

First the pathways are not as strong, then a bit stronger and as you

some projects and all yourselfl - you will make a strong pattern.

<h2 id="org2b7f9e7">Classification algorithms</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2b7f9e7">
<p>
There is a lot of classification algorithms available now but it is
not possible to conclude which one is superior to other. It depends on
the application and nature of available data set. For example, if the
classes are linearly separable, the linear classifiers like Logistic
regression, Fisher’s linear discriminant can outperform sophisticated
models and vice versa.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org08fd7cd" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org08fd7cd">Decision Tree</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org08fd7cd">

<figure id="org2f96556">
<img src="./static/images/decision-tree.png" alt="decision-tree.png" width="1200px">

</figure>

<p>
Decision tree builds classification or regression models in the form
of a tree structure. It utilizes an if-then rule set. The rules are
learned sequentially using the training data one at a time. Each time
a rule is learned, the tuples covered by the rules are removed. This
process is continued on the training set until meeting a termination
condition.
</p>

<p>
The tree is constructed in a top-down recursive divide-and-conquer
manner. All the attributes should be categorical. Otherwise, they
should be discretized in advance? Attributes in the top of the tree
have more impact towards in the classification and they are identified
using the information gain concept.
</p>

<p>
A decision tree can be easily over-fitted generating too many branches
and may reflect anomalies due to noise or outliers. An over-fitted
model has a very poor performance on the unseen data even though it
gives an impressive performance on training data.
</p>

<p>
This can be avoided by pre-pruning which halts tree construction early
or post-pruning which removes branches from the fully grown tree.
What?

<div id="outline-container-orgb07afcb" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgb07afcb">Naive Bayes</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb07afcb">
<p>
Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier inspired by the Bayes
theorem under a simple assumption which is the attributes are
conditionally independent.
</p>


<figure id="org5244731">
<img src="./static/images/naive-bayes-formula.png" alt="naive-bayes-formula.png" width="1200px">

</figure>

<p>
Naive Bayes is a very simple algorithm to implement and good results
have obtained in most cases. It can be easily scalable to larger
datasets since it takes linear time, rather than by expensive
iterative approximation as used for many other types of classifiers.
</p>

<p>
Naive Bayes can suffer from a problem called the zero probability
problem. When the conditional probability is zero for a particular
attribute, it fails to give a valid prediction. This needs to be fixed
explicitly using a Laplacian estimator?.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org6bd3b7d" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org6bd3b7d">Artificial Neuraul Networks</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6bd3b7d">
<p>
Artificial Neural Network is a set of connected input/output units
where each connection has a weight associated. During the learning
phase, the network learns by adjusting the weights so as to be able to
predict the correct class label of the input tuples.
</p>

<p>
There are many network architectures available:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Feed-forward</li>

<li>Convolutional</li>

<li>Recurrent</li>
</ul>

<p>
There can be multiple hidden layers in the model depending on the
complexity of the function which is going to be mapped by the model.
Having more hidden layers will enable to model complex relationships
such as deep neural networks.
</p>

<p>
However, when there are many hidden layers, it takes a lot of time to
train and adjust wights. The other disadvantage of is the poor
interpretability of model compared to other models like Decision Trees
due to the unknown symbolic meaning behind the learned weights.
</p>

<p>
But Artificial Neural Networks have performed impressively in most of
the real world applications. It has high tolerance to noisy data and
is able to classify untrained patterns. Usually, Artificial Neural
Networks perform better with continuous-valued inputs and outputs.
</p>

<p>
All of the above algorithms are eager learners since they train a
model in advance to generalize the training data and use it for
prediction later.

<img src="./static/images/k-nearest-neighbors.png" alt="k-nearest-neighbors.png" width="1200px">

</figure>

<p>
k-Nearest Neighbor is a lazy learning algorithm which stores all
instances correspond to training data points in n-dimensional space.
When an unknown discrete data is received, it analyzes the closest k
number of instances saved (nearest neighbors)and returns the most
common class as the prediction and for real-valued data it returns the
mean of k nearest neighbors.

There are several methods exists and the most common method is the
holdout method. In this method, the given data set is divided into 2
partitions as test and train 20% and 80% respectively. The train set
will be used to train the model and the unseen test data(aaaa, unseen
data, I see now) will be used to test its predictive power.

Over-fitting is a common problem in machine learning which can occur
in most models. k-fold cross-validation can be conducted to verify
that the model is not over-fitted. In this method, the data-set is
randomly partitioned into k mutually exclusive subsets, each
approximately equal size and one is kept for testing while others are
used for training. This process is iterated throughout the whole k
folds.Sorry what?

<p>
ROC curve is used for visual comparison of classification models which
shows the trade-off between the true positive rate and the false
positive rate. The area under the ROC curve is a measure of the
accuracy of the model. When a model is closer to the diagonal, it is
less accurate and the model with perfect accuracy will have an area of
1.0

<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/support-vector-machine-introduction-to-machine-learning-algorithms-934a444fca47">Link</a>
</p>

<p>
Support vector machine is highly preferred by many as it produces
significant accuracy with less computation power. Support Vector
Machine can be used for both regression and classification tasks. But,
it is widely used in classification objectives.
</p>

<p>
The objective of the support vector machine algorithm is to find a
hyperplane in an N-dimensional space(N — the number of features) that
distinctly classifies the data points.
</p>


<figure id="org61f9166">

</figure>


<figure id="org7582a85">
<img src="./static/images/hyperplanes2.png" alt="hyperplanes2.png" width="1200px">

</figure>

<p>
To separate the two classes of data points, there are many possible
hyperplanes that could be chosen. Our objective is to find a plane
that has the maximum margin, i.e the maximum distance between data
points of both classes. Maximizing the margin distance provides some
reinforcement so that future data points can be classified with more
confidence.
</p>

<h3 id="org3b0d18f">Hyperplanes and Support Vectors</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3b0d18f">

<figure id="org6fcfa92">
<img src="./static/images/hyperplane3d.png" alt="hyperplane3d.png" width="1200px">

</figure>

<p>
Hyperplanes are decision boundaries that help classify the data
points. Data points falling on either side of the hyperplane can be
attributed to different classes. Also, the dimension of the hyperplane
depends upon the number of features. If the number of input features
is 2, then the hyperplane is just a line. If the number of input
features is 3, then the hyperplane becomes a two-dimensional plane. It
becomes difficult to imagine when the number of features exceeds 3.
</p>


<figure id="org124cd3d">
<img src="./static/images/support-vectors.png" alt="support-vectors.png" width="1200px">

</figure>

<p>
Support vectors are data points that are closer to the hyperplane and
influence the position and orientation of the hyperplane. Using these
support vectors, we maximize the margin of the classifier. Deleting
the support vectors will change the position of the hyperplane. These
are the points that help us build our SVM.

<p>
Logistic Regression was used in the biological sciences in early
twentieth century. It was then used in many social science
applications. Logistic Regression is used when the dependent
variable(target) is categorical.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To predict whether an email is spam (1) or (0)</li>
<li>Whether the tumor is malignant (1) or not (0)</li>
</ul>

Logistic regression models the probabilities for classification
problems with two possible outcomes. It's an extension of the linear
regression model for classification problems

</figure>

<p>
K-means clustering is one of the simplest and popular unsupervised
machine learning algorithms.
</p>

<p>
The objective of K-means is simple: group similar data points together
and discover underlying patterns. To achieve this objective, K-means
looks for a fixed number (k) of clusters in a dataset.
</p>

<p>
A cluster refers to a collection of data points aggregated together
because of certain similarities.
</p>

<p>
You’ll define a target number k, which refers to the number of centroids you need in the dataset. A centroid is the imaginary or real location representing the center of the cluster.
</p>

<p>
Every data point is allocated to each of the clusters through reducing
the in-cluster sum of squares? Hm?

<p>
Lots of k's here
</p>

<p>
Cross-validation is a statistical method used to estimate the skill of
machine learning models.
</p>

<p>
It is commonly used in applied machine learning to compare and select
a model for a given predictive modeling problem because it is easy to
understand, easy to implement, and results in skill estimates that
generally have a lower bias than other methods.
</p>

<p>
Oh, so there are even methods to compare and select a model?!? Why do
you even need humans for then? Let the machine face a problem, it will
select the method to solve it and then solve it. Uh, even data
scientists might become unecessary soon. Overexaggerating of course,
but damn.

<p>
Some random vim - okay I can not Not share <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c68MkeMBjhE">this</a>. During my long
pomodoro break I found this vim shortcut tutorial. Learned a bunch.
You can use numbers in the commands? Mindblown.
</p>

<p>
I think I will also install some plugins for my vim. Been using it raw
since I first installed it. Making these pages is quite slow when you
constantly have to add paragraphs, make lists, make the text bald and
etc, so I think emmet-vim is a good first pluging for me. Later I
would like something that would autocorrect my text lol since I am
still getting used to homerow key typing and making some mistakes from
time to time (although surprisingly no mistakes in the last sentence
:o). Aaand what else. It would be nice to browse throuhgt my system in
vim, to acces files quickly, hm ah yeah, this thing called syntax
highlighting would also be nice. That might be in one of the plugins
that the guy above in the picture has.
</p>

<p>
You don't imagine how often I think about just using sublime or some
other code editor environment where everything looks so nice and
colorful. But then I remember all those hardcore dudes on youtube that
tell you to use vim, since after climbing that steep learning curve
it's all smooth sailing from there. I wouldn't want to believe them
blindly, but when I am using octave for example or some other program,
can't remember which, AND I get to use the same keybinds like in vim
or in linux in general, I get shocked! If I learn vim and linux I can
pretty much do and edit stuff anywhere, the workflow will be so
smooth! So yeah, sticking with vim for now, will try to get some
plugins, maybe it will make my experience more enjoyable :)

  <description><![CDATA[

<figure id="org2e16db0">
<img src="./static/images/squirrel.png" alt="squirrel.png" width="1200px">

</figure>

<p>
Main inspiration - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDzsrmMl48I&amp;t=604s">this guy</a>.
</p>

<p>
A guy that explained this concept to me is competing in coding
competitions. It's the first time I hear about those, but I imagine
you have to know a lot of different methods for solving problems,
because when the contest comes, you don’t know what problem you are
going to get.
</p>

<p>
Recently, when I started to think about effective ways of learning a
new subject, I came up to people saying to learn things broadly, to
just scratch the surface of the new subjects instead of what I used to
always do - learn as much as I can (like a squirrel with cheeks full
of nuts) about a topic. According to them, after having general
knowledge of the field/s you can take up a project and deepen the
knowledge along the way.
</p>

<p>
So let's say there is a field that I want to get into. Conveniently I
have such a field - Data science. Data science includes many topics:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Mathematics</li>
<li>Statistics</li>
<li>Programming languages (Python, R)</li>
<li>Data cleanign and visualization - (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)</li>
<li>Exploring the data (SQL)?</li>
<li>Machine learnign algorithms</li>
<li>Deep learning (all about neural networks)</li>
<li>SQL &amp; MongoDb (working with databases)</li>
<li>BI tools (creating interactive visualizations)</li>
</ul>

<p>
and so on…
</p>

<p>
So, If I want to get into the field AND I am learning by myself from
scratch, creating my own small project and working on it. Would it be
smart for me to start with and dive very very deep in mathematics?
Know the ins and outs of it needed for data science?
</p>

<p>
As I came to see it, it is worth investing some time to explore ALL
those major fields BEFORE you actually proceed to learn one specific
topic in depth.
</p>

<p>
Why is that?
</p>

<p>
Well, If for example I get a piece of data from somewhere (I am still
working on that.. Not sure how, what kind and from where to get it)
and I am only focusing on mathematics, I won’t know what else exactly
is there I can do with that piece of data. Can I create a
visualization, can I make a dashboard or reports, can I get some
insights from it? I lack a lot of general knowledge, all I know is
math.
</p>


<figure id="orgf0d1042">
<img src="./static/images/black-box1.png" alt="black-box1.png" width="1200px">

</figure>

<p>
I learn concept-1 (mathematics), but the rest of the topics are
unknown to me.
</p>

<p>
Would it be smart if I take concept-2 and concept-3 from the unknown
row and only then proceed with learning one topic in depth. In that
case, I have knowledge of all of the topics, broad knowledge (I am
going to learn it in depth anyway, so it's only good that I started to
learn it already) so if sa project or a difficulty appears, I know
about the possible tools I have in my reach that I can use to solve
the problem. Yes, I don’t have an in depth knowledge of concept-2 and
concept-3, but it is better than not having ANY knowledge.
</p>

<p>
So, okay.
</p>

<p>
This is what I am going to do. I will spend the next few days getting
an understanding of those fields I mentioned above, so when I am
solving a particular problem related with data, I will have an idea
what else is there that is possible to achieve with the data that I
have.
</p>

<p>
It's an easy gap to cross versus understanding the whole thing. Black
box all the concepts before starting to fully learn them. It is not a
substitute for learning them, just for the start.
</p>

<p>
It is an intermediate step, except it has no drawbacks, you are going
to learn this stuff anyway. So it is only going to benefit you.
</p>

<p>
<b>Advantages</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Works quickly - information required to USE something is much less
than the information required to fully understand something.</li>

<li>Keeps the learning focused - you know what everything is “doing”,
you know what purpose of it is. All you are doing when you are
transitioning from having something black boxed to learning it
norma+lly - you are just figuring out how it works. You already know
what it does, you already know everything required to use it, you
are just understanding the internal mechanisms of it.</li>

<li>Makes learning less scary - when you understand the underlying
purpose of something it makes it a lot less scary to learn it for
real, because you know the end result already, it is just figuring
out how it gets there.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I would like to believe that by doing so I am learning from my
mistakes that I made when trying to cram all the knowledge about one
field in my head (machine learning algorithms when doing the coursera
course. It would have been beneficial to know somy python so I could
graph the gradient descent and play with it, have some actual data to
work with and so on.. Instead of just staring at one algorithm).

<img src="./static/images/black-box2.png" alt="black-box2.png" width="1200px">

</figure>

<p>
Whether you choose to use it or not is up to you, but it can’t hurt,
for sure. It takes a really short time, like mere minutes for a single
topic. It involves information that you would eventually have to learn
anyway and it also gives you a brief but sufficient (sufficient for
using it) introduction to topics, allowing you to use them much
quicker than you would be able to if you decide to learn them all
fully in sequence.
</p>

<p>
p.s. damn it takes a lot of time to write this html document in a
proper way. I sometimes miss Word document, but sometimes I don't. Vim
has it's own advantages, but I am new with it so I am a little bit
slow. Learned how to yank, paste a word or a whole line today.

I would really like to have some actual data to work with, but I can
not find any that I would 1-know how to read, 2-know how to work with,
3-would not get frustrated just by looking at csv file full of digits
and and commas.
</p>

<p>
Creating my own dataset just by typing words and numbers in a google
sheet is possible(and probably I will end up doing that and using what
I come up with for the next two weeks), but&#x2026; I forgot what I wanted
to say.
</p>

<p>
The thing is, according to my "plan" I am supposed to be learning
about excel and statistics right now, but for some reason as I watch a
tutorial or read a book (think stats) I come up to a road block which
tells me that to continue you need to know how to use python or how to
use excel. 1-I dont know how to use python and I am supposed to learn
in in 2 weeks(according to my plan :D) and 2-I dont have excel on my
computer (need to install in on linux through vine after finding a
free ISO&#x2026;) and google sheets lacks some functions that I see
tutorials about&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Again, I don't feel that I am progressing anywhere, I am just looking
at various ways to get data, learning about various types of data and
basically finding out ways of how NOT to start learning DS :D But it's
alright, I'll get there.
</p>

<p>
Lets focus on excel for the rest of today. 16:20
</p>

<p>
Filters in excel a quite useful.
</p>

<p>
<b>Filters</b> in - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMlTDXPEjag&amp;t=21s">excel</a> are quite useful. Watching in 1.5x speed just to
get an idea of what is possible. Totals, nice. Transform your data
into a table to get an easy totals/averages and so on. You get not
only filering options but also your forumulas or charts referencing
the data - they both get updated. Kay, will keep in mind.
</p>

<p>
Formulas and Functions by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jl0Qk63z2ZY">guy</a> who works at Microsoft :D.
</p>

<p>
Been seeing median here and there, so here is a refresher:
</p>


<figure id="org1a6fb46">
<img src="./static/images/median-math-is-fun.png" alt="median-math-is-fun.png" width="1200px">

</figure>

<p>
<b>Concatenate</b> - =CONCAT(x1,x2) takes value from one row, then from the
other one that you selec and separate with comman and puts them
together in one "langeli".
</p>

<p>
<b>If</b> - <code>IF(D13</code>"smile", "yay", "boo") good times Csongor, good times ;) IF
a field equals to a word "smile", the returned value will be "yay", if
the field equals to anything else than "smile", returns the value
"boo".
</p>

<p>
<b>Countif</b> - Selecting a range of values and asking the formula to
calculate how many instances that we have specied are in the given
range. For example. =COUNTIF(B1:G7, 1) formula presents me with a
number that tells me how many numbers "1" are in the field that I
asked to look in.
</p>

<p>
<b>Vlookup</b> - things are getting more interesting. So Vlookup looks at the
table, lest say the table has two values&#x2026; you know, let me just put
an image rly quick (more vim and html practice on top of that).
</p>


<figure id="org74f423b">
<img src="./static/images/vlookup.png" alt="vlookup.png" width="1200px">

</figure>

<p>
So the formula that found out the favorite color of ciongibongi is as
such - =VLOOKUP(D18,D15:E18,2,FALSE)
</p>

<p>
<b>Sumif</b> - is a nice function I guess but wont make an example, I am
aware of it alright.
</p>

<p>
p.s. damn it takes a lot of time to write this html document in a
proper way. I sometimes miss Word document, but sometimes I don't. Vim
has it's own advantages, but I am new with it so I am a little bit
slow. Learned how to yank, paste a word or a whole line today.

  <title><![CDATA[Thoughts on Achieving Goals]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
How good is it to work 24/7 on one particular thing?
</p>

<p>
Might Look like a great idea, you will get accoomplished a lot, right?
But only in one area. F.x. Programming. But what about your health,
the body that actually allows you to be learning this stuff. Who will
take care of it? Diet, exercise, mobility, simply movement. Who will
take care of all the other things in your life And all of this is
CRUCIAL for being productive, really. You can not have NO food and be
productive. You can not have breaks where you exercise because you
wont clear you head, find new ideas and at the same time train your
mind. You must do those. Damn balance is very very important. Have to
have everything in your life in order to be good at one particular
thing, no? But hm there are examples of people who are super super
good at one subject and suck at others. Like programmers f.x, they
dont rally care about their bodies right? But its probably the battle
you choose.. I personally think its important for me to take care of
my body first and ONLY and WHEN I do that I will be productive and
find time for other things. Just like at 12th grade, remember? You had
so many things on your to do list and managed to do all of them. The
more busy you are the more you can accomplish. Books, guitar,
exercise, cold showers, food, programming, shop, relatives, friends,
etc etc are all possible and should be tried to be managed. Like in
todays video - streching video Says the more you strech per day doesn't
increse the benefits, but that frequency of 6 days a week and 5
minutes total for that week is what's important. 6 days a week 5
minutes total = yield best streching results, more is simply not
necessary. This shocked me a little, simply because I agree on it and
I was acting completely different the entire last month. I would think
that I am working just because I am spending a lot of time on it, but
I was simply staying in place in terms of my progress.
</p>

<p>
Look at yourself now. Today, its 11am, you ate, you have already found
time to learn about calculus and feel good about the direction you are
going to. You did run for 10 or so mins, you did 4x10 squats with 10kg
on your back, you wanted to go to the shop but didnt take your mask
with you, you came back and took a cold shower, got into fresh clothes
and went back to study and now you are even doing stuff with your
website. All of this would not have been possible if I would have
stayed with the previous or Lex Fridman mindset to focus on one thing
only. Not Lex, its mostly mine, because I have been like this my whole
life. It is either ALL or NOTHING. But maybe the middle path is the
right choice, right, Candy?
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org9863e85" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org9863e85">Parkinson's Law</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9863e85">
<p>
Parkinson's Law is the old adage that work expands to fill the time
allotted. Put simply, the amount of work required adjusts to the time
available for its completion.
</p>

<p>
It also illustrates very well what I was expriencing. The more time I
have, the more work will appear. But as we have seen from the
streching example - more work does not necessarily bring better
results.

  <title><![CDATA[Addict]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
When I am learning without a plan or an idea of what I am doing, I get
in this mode of constant kind of anxiety, feeling that I can ONLY
spend my time of the things I am trying to learn, that god forbid I
will waste some time by washing clothes or getting a shave or
something - all that seems like a waste of time.
</p>

<p>
But now, since I am more relaxed, following the pomodoro technique,
ticking off things from my sunday to-do list, it is only 11:30 and I
have already done a lot of things that help to keep my days(life) in
balance. AND at the same time I still have loads of time to do HOURS
of learning. Productive time, with calm mind, because other things are
sorted and not at the back of my mind.
</p>

<p>
I used to be this person that gets into an "addiction" kind of mode
trying to complete and perfect a task (Revit in Denmark, Garden in
Nepal, linux and other things now). Nothing else is important, only me
and the task. I am forced to believe that this is a bad trait and I am
kind of relieved thinking about it as a bad trait, because I don't get
as much work done by taking care other things in my life, but what I
realized, that the “addiction” type of work mode didn't actually get
me a lot of work done. I was just staring at the material without
understanding what it was about. So most of my effort went into the
task and only small amount of it was actually productive.
</p>

<p>
Really, for the next 6 months I will be doing this passive learning.
Now it sounds good, I like it, I got structure, I have a path, I have
the reasons “why”, now all I have to do is follow that path. It's all
on me now.
</p>

<p>
5mins to write this and its so good. Just dumped it out.
</p>

<p>
p.s. Okay, I have re-read this after some hours and I see it doesn't
really make much sence if you are not ME. I think I won't always try
to make my "brain dump" material clearly understandable by others. For
now, all of this is purely for me. To practice working on a keyboard,
to practice using vim, to practice building website pages from time
to time. So yeah :)

  <title><![CDATA[Focused and Difused learning]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[

<figure id="orgca496ef">
<img src="./static/images/focused-diffuse.png" alt="focused-diffuse.png" width="1200px">

</figure>

<p>
The diffuse mode could be thought of as a flashlight set so that it
casts its light very broadly, but not very strongly in any one area.
(As opposed to the focused mode, which would have its light cast very
strongly in a single area, but very weakly everywhere else). Focused -
The type of thinking you need to do when you are trying to understand
something new.
</p>


<figure id="org874aaa9">
<img src="./static/images/learning-flashlight.jpeg" alt="learning-flashlight.jpeg" width="1200px">

</figure>

<div id="outline-container-orge574a6d" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge574a6d">Focused mode</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge574a6d">
<p>
<b>Focused mode</b> - like paintball. Think of something, the thought goes
from one neuron to the other. As it is bouncing on the bumpers, you
are able to solve a problem of something you are rather familiar with.
Thought moves smoothly along the already existing neural pathway -
moving on a familiar, nicely paved road.
</p>

<p>
Trying to do a multiplication problem or looking for a certain word in
your mind - probably stepping along the familiar pathways of the
focused mode.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org764876d" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org764876d">Diffuse mode</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org764876d">
<p>
<b>Diffused thinking</b> - relaxed. You haven't thought before - you don't
know where the pattern\path is. All the other neurons are blocking the
patterns. New neural pathways have a way to appear, because you don't
bump into anything. (diffused mode).
</p>

<p>
If you are trying to solve a new problem it often cries out for the
more broad ranging perspectives of the diffuse mode.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Dancing</b> in a relaxed and free form manner, without concentrating on anything</li>

<li>arouse the diffuse(rather than focused) mode.</li>

<li>Tag along in the passenger seaet of a car, looking absently out the window while someone else is driving.</li>

<li>Arouse the diffuse(rather than focused) mode.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc1065c8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgc1065c8">Can't have both</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc1065c8">
<p>
When we find ourselves stuck on a problem, or even if we’re unsure of
a situation, the course of living our daily life. It's often a good
idea once you’ve focused directly on the situation to let things
settle back and take a bit more time. That way more neural processing
can take place, often below conscious awareness in the diffuse mode.
</p>

<p>
One mode limits the access to the other type of mode. Either one or
the other side of the coin, can not have both, same with thinking
modes. Either one or the other type of thinking.
</p>


<figure id="org2b8a4dd">
<img src="./static/images/salvador-sleep.jpg" alt="salvador-sleep.jpg" width="1200px">

</figure>

<p>
<b>Salvador Dali</b> - Relaxing in the chair, vaguely thinking what he was
previously focusing on, holding keys, falling asleep, then when the
keys fall down, he wakes up and then goes to paint with the new
connections that he has just made while in the diffuse mode.
</p>

<p>
He suggests that the elements of creativity process are Preparation–
know your domain, Concentration– intense focus, Incubation– relax and
do something the polar opposite, Illumination– breakthrough on the
ideas and Verification– test the idea.
</p>

<p>
Salvador Dali also wrote a book called the ‘Fifty secrets of Magic
Craftsmanship'(1948)
</p>


<figure id="orgc8291a4">
<img src="./static/images/thomas-edison.png" alt="thomas-edison.png" width="1200px">

</figure>

<p>
<b>Thomas Edison</b> did something similar.
</p>

<p>
During his day, Edison would take time out by himself and relax in a
chair or on a sofa. Invariably he would be working on a new invention
and seeking creative solutions to the problem he was dealing with. He
knew that if her could get into that "twilight state" between being
awake and being asleep, he could access the pure creative genius of
his subconscious mind.
</p>

<p>
To prevent himself from crossing all the way over the "genius gap"
into deep sleep, he would nap with his hand propped up on his elbow
while he clutched a handful of ball-bearings. Then he would just drift
off to sleep, knowing that his subconscious mind would take up the
challenge of his problem and provide a solution. As soon as he went
into too deep a sleep, his hand would drop and the ball-bearings would
spill noisily on the floor, waking him up again. He'd then write down
whatever was in his mind.

<h2 id="org054832a">Sum up</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org054832a">
<p>
Mind needs to go from one to the other mode to learn effectively.
</p>

<p>
Learning something difficult takes time. Brain needs to alternate its
ways of learning as it grapples with and assimilates the new material.
</p>

<p>
To gain muscles you need to work everyday. Little work everyday,
gradually allow yourself to grow. A LITTLE BIT EVERYDAY!!! Thank you
lady for making me change my mind about learning and being productive.

This page is an overview of tools I like to use, and technologies I
enjoy.

<h2 id="org8f3b813">Core Technologies</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8f3b813">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
<b>Personal Operating System: Ubuntu Linux</b>
</p>

<p>
I use Windows daily at work, and know it intimately, and have used
macOS in the past. They all work; they all break. But Linux gives me
a fighting chance to fix the most annoying problems myself, which is
why it is my operating system of choice at the moment (but these
things tend to change frequently).
</p></li>

<li><p>
<b>Browser: Chrome</b>
</p>

<p>
At this point, mostly my choice out of inertia, due to a number of
extensions I like and use.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<b>Code Editor: Emacs</b>
</p>

<p>
I do most of my work in a text editor. My emacs is my own, it is a
custom-built tool for my particular way of working, mostly
keyboard-driven. I am under no illusions that this way of working is
“more efficient” than other ways, but it sure gives me joy. I like
the soothing simplicity of this.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<b>Image Editor: Lightroom</b>
</p>

<p>
I photograph less and less these days, but when I do, I need to
retouch the images - I find a windows machine and do image editing
on it with Lightroom. Been using it for many years. Helped other use
it as well.

<b>Python</b>

When I need to automate or script, or when I want to explore, Python
is a pragmatic choice. Fast enough for most tasks, with libraries
for everything imaginable.
