Main reason to sit down and write this because Linux started behaving weirdly..
as I open a program (browser for example), it would show that it has been
opened, but I wouldn't see the window, couldn't interract with it.
</p>

<p>
It is a first time such thing has happened. I could open anki, could open
terminal and so on, but not a browser, not a "localbyflywheel" or "xampp".
</p>

<p>
And so I don't want to wait until tomorrow or for monday to fix this, I would
like to find a solution now so I can continue watching my downloaded tutorials
and follow them without any prblems&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Alright so hi again. Will make this quick and perhaps later will edit it more.
</p>

<p>
The situation now is this - it has been 5 days since I have taken my sim-card
with an internet from my smartphone and put it inside a flip phone that I
bought purely for this experiment and
</p>

<p>
Honestly I wanted it for a really long time.
</p>

<p>
Friday evening, I am sitting at home&#x2026; you know what, instead of trying to fix
my linux and install arch and all that, why don't I just go get some sweet
stawberries, sit in the balcony and read a book in the sun&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Just came back to the computer after finishing reading the turing test&#x2026; it
has been a while on my shelf, but probably wasn't the good time to read it yet,
didnt get much of it.

I loved not being able to take picture of whateve moment I was in, I was able
to just be in it
</p>

<p>
I loved to be forced out of the library to take a break from "coding",
researching, because I would have never done that by myeself
</p>

<p>
I loved being dependent on the internet in the library, if I wanted to know
something new - I had to go there and connect to the internet.
</p>

<p>
I loved the bits of time that I got to do nothing. When I am bored.. I would
just sit down and look around, or most often I would pick up kindle and start
reading. Way better than mindless scrolling.
</p>

<p>
I loved the time that I had when I came back from the library after 6pm. I
would know okay I have 3-4 hours before I hit the bed, if there was nothing
urgent to do on my computer, then I would get up and move.
</p>

<p>
I loved that I took time to lear someting new.. I mean I would have done that
otherwise as well, but this time if I have one video that I downloaded, I
coudnt just skip it and watch a different one
</p>

<p>
As soon as I was bored, I had to stick with it, watch it until the end and
usually I was happy I did that becauce I learned something.
</p>

<p>
Same can go with all the things I didnt like. Sometimes yes, I wanted to have
my phone there to take and share that picture, yes I wanted to google an answer
to something and yeah sometimes some music would be nice..
</p>

<p>
I felt like I was back in Nepal Vipassana center&#x2026; only calm moments around
me&#x2026; not many distractions, mind is no constantly bombarded with music,
unlimited amount of information at my fingertips 24/7,
</p>

<p>
No music to get me distracted, no other kinds of bullshit&#x2026; This kind of
lifestyle is my preferred actually.
</p>

<p>
But since I am not in a Vipassana center, I shouldn't totally restrict myself
from things.. Balance is everything, right? Why don't I take these lessons and
observations about myself and apply them
</p>

<p>
in my days that are ahead.. I am sure I will be more mindful.
</p>

<p>
Everything in moderation&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Last p tag. I will have to end here, going to insert the sim card into my
smartphone and connect to the interwebs once again, but this time more mindful.
