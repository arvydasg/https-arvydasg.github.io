<p>
When I am learning without a plan or an idea of what I am doing, I get
in this mode of constant kind of anxiety, feeling that I can ONLY
spend my time of the things I am trying to learn, that god forbid I
will waste some time by washing clothes or getting a shave or
something - all that seems like a waste of time.
</p>

<p>
But now, since I am more relaxed, following the pomodoro technique,
ticking off things from my sunday to-do list, it is only 11:30 and I
have already done a lot of things that help to keep my days(life) in
balance. AND at the same time I still have loads of time to do HOURS
of learning. Productive time, with calm mind, because other things are
sorted and not at the back of my mind.
</p>

<p>
I used to be this person that gets into an "addiction" kind of mode
trying to complete and perfect a task (Revit in Denmark, Garden in
Nepal, linux and other things now). Nothing else is important, only me
and the task. I am forced to believe that this is a bad trait and I am
kind of relieved thinking about it as a bad trait, because I don't get
as much work done by taking care other things in my life, but what I
realized, that the “addiction” type of work mode didn't actually get
me a lot of work done. I was just staring at the material without
understanding what it was about. So most of my effort went into the
task and only small amount of it was actually productive.
</p>

<p>
Really, for the next 6 months I will be doing this passive learning.
Now it sounds good, I like it, I got structure, I have a path, I have
the reasons “why”, now all I have to do is follow that path. It's all
on me now.
</p>

<p>
5mins to write this and its so good. Just dumped it out.
</p>

<p>
p.s. Okay, I have re-read this after some hours and I see it doesn't
really make much sence if you are not ME. I think I won't always try
to make my "brain dump" material clearly understandable by others. For
now, all of this is purely for me. To practice working on a keyboard,
to practice using vim, to practice building website pages from time
to time. So yeah :)
