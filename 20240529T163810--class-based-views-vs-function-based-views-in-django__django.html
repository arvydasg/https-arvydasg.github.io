It is a matter of taste. BUT using classes might give you less code. A pattern
to follow can be:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>if you can use one of the generic classes, then use it</li>
<li>if you can use the normal view class without too much hassle, then do it.</li>
<li>and the last resort is function based views</li>
</ul>

<p>
But when that is said, I almost always use functions because I love them. And
that is also a good practice to follow
</p>

<p>
BASICALLY DOING CVB's only to get experience in OOP. OOP will be useful when
working with django admin and overall, OOP knowledge is a must, I have grown to
that. Even though I like function views more, let's work with CLASS BASED
VIEWS.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
if you are performing a more complex operation, handling multiple forms at
once, a function-based view will serve you better.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
If you find you’re struggling to implement your view as a subclass of a generic
view, then you may find it more effective to write just the code you need,
using your own class-based or functional views.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
Serving a noble purpose of code de-duplication, class-based views often offer
the cure that is worse than the disease. The code gets messy in an attempt to
save or reuse a few lines of code.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
Just ignore all generic CBVs, and stick to the View base class! You don’t need
to use anything other to use CBVs and make your project work.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
If you’re new to Django, or new to using class based views, it’s completely
acceptable to stick to building on top of the View class. I’d go as far, as
saying that it’s recommended when starting out and the best choice if you feel
overwhelmed.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
Simple is better than complex
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
The third line in the Zen of Python is a good guiding rule, and applies in this
case.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
Usually, it's just easier to write your own non-generic view, than trying to
use them unprepared.I prefer the class-based views which are based on the View
class, unless the project is large enough that there's a lot of repetition
going on
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
CBV's:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Karina chooses CBV's almost all the time.</li>
<li>Shipping project is also full of CBV's (django admin)</li>
<li>good for large codebases</li>
<li>leveling up in OOP</li>
<li>goal is to be good at OOP</li>
<li>good resource is out there, means that I am not the only one using CBV's ;)</li>
</ul>
