Hey look at me, once again typing in vim on Linux without any plugins. Writing
all the html tags by hand.

So, my current interests are: Kali, js, php, vim, linux shell, python.
</p>

<p>
Seems like every day I find something more intersting than I learned was
studying before. Because of the internet situation - I started to read more.
Finally opened the humble bundle thingy, found some interesting books, about
shell, python and so on&#x2026; If I was using linux until now and would not have
changed to windows, I would be quite good in both Linux and vim by now I think.
So my question still exists&#x2026; should I do things little by little&#x2026; many
things at the same time but spending little time to each or take only
JAVASCRIPT from now on ant put my 100% effort into it. Leaving it as that for
now..

Today its evening of Wednesday. Since monday I have been without internet on my
phone, meaning - no internet at home as well. But I stil had to study and do
the ecommerce website for the sausage people, so every day I would spend in the
library just 10min on bike from me. So far its going good, the only thing I am
worried about is my bike getting stolen and the heavy laptop that I have to
carry with me all the way there and back. But that is okay, the time in the
library is worth it. I spend 0 time wasting my time there doing random things
or waching youtube. I know that from 11:00 to 11:30 and from 15:00 to 15:30 -
is the time when the room I am staying in has to be ventilated. What that means
is that I am forced to get up and take a break. If not it, I doubt that I would
take breaks. I love them so far. I go the the very heart of my city, lie on the
bench in the sun and read a book. I would never do that if I stayed the whole
day in my appartment. Also during one of the breaks I am forced to eat or go to
the gym&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I feel that having breaks is important, I experience it myself, so when the
week is over and I am back with the internet, I will know how to use it more
mindfully.

Again I got this feeling of my computer being dirty with all the dual boot
windows and ubuntu, so I decided to install Linux solo and maybe run a virtual
box of windows when I need to use Lightroom to edit my pictures and so on.
Struggling a little wiht it once a gain, but the muscle memory helps me. I need
to get some addons for vim, I would like to start reading manuals for vim and
shell commands, get better to know them&#x2026; would like to work with tiling
window manager, like dwm, but on a clean slate.. something like arch maybe. Now
on ubuntu I can not get it working properly, there are some gliches when I
change between the tabs in dwm and yeah&#x2026; just having all that "bloat".. it
better wouldnt be there. VIM man&#x2026; ctrl+z command that I got used to when in
Windows now is messing up my vim experience. I press it when I want to undo
something and my whole document is gone, gg :)
