A guy that explained this concept to me is competing in coding competitions.
It's the first time I hear about those, but I imagine you have to know a lot of
different methods for solving problems, because when the contest comes, you
don’t know what problem you are going to get.
</p>

<p>
Recently, when I started to think about effective ways of learning a new
subject, I came up to people saying to learn things broadly, to just scratch
the surface of the new subjects instead of what I used to always do - learn as
much as I can (like a squirrel with cheeks full of nuts) about a topic.
According to them, after having general knowledge of the field/s you can take
up a project and deepen the knowledge along the way.
</p>

<p>
So let's say there is a field that I want to get into. Conveniently I have such
a field - Data science. Data science includes many topics:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Mathematics</li>
<li>Statistics</li>
<li>Programming languages (Python, R)</li>
<li>Data cleanign and visualization - (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)</li>
<li>Exploring the data (SQL)?</li>
<li>Machine learnign algorithms</li>
<li>Deep learning (all about neural networks)</li>
<li>SQL &amp; MongoDb (working with databases)</li>
<li>BI tools (creating interactive visualizations)</li>
</ul>

<p>
and so on…
</p>

<p>
So, If I want to get into the field AND I am learning by myself from scratch,
creating my own small project and working on it. Would it be smart for me to
start with and dive very very deep in mathematics? Know the ins and outs of it
needed for data science?
</p>

<p>
As I came to see it, it is worth investing some time to explore ALL those major
fields BEFORE you actually proceed to learn one specific topic in depth.
</p>

<p>
Why is that?
</p>

<p>
Well, If for example I get a piece of data from somewhere (I am still working
on that.. Not sure how, what kind and from where to get it) and I am only
focusing on mathematics, I won’t know what else exactly is there I can do with
that piece of data. Can I create a visualization, can I make a dashboard or
reports, can I get some insights from it? I lack a lot of general knowledge,
all I know is math.
</p>

</figure>

<p>
I learn concept-1 (mathematics), but the rest of the topics are unknown to me.
</p>

<p>
Would it be smart if I take concept-2 and concept-3 from the unknown row and
only then proceed with learning one topic in depth. In that case, I have
knowledge of all of the topics, broad knowledge (I am going to learn it in
depth anyway, so it's only good that I started to learn it already) so if sa
project or a difficulty appears, I know about the possible tools I have in my
reach that I can use to solve the problem. Yes, I don’t have an in depth
knowledge of concept-2 and concept-3, but it is better than not having ANY
knowledge.
</p>

<p>
So, okay.
</p>

<p>
This is what I am going to do. I will spend the next few days getting an
understanding of those fields I mentioned above, so when I am solving a
particular problem related with data, I will have an idea what else is there
that is possible to achieve with the data that I have.
</p>

<p>
It's an easy gap to cross versus understanding the whole thing. Black box all
the concepts before starting to fully learn them. It is not a substitute for
learning them, just for the start.
</p>

<p>
It is an intermediate step, except it has no drawbacks, you are going to learn
this stuff anyway. So it is only going to benefit you.
</p>

<p>
<b>Advantages</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Works quickly - information required to USE something is much less than the
information required to fully understand something.</li>

<li>Keeps the learning focused - you know what everything is “doing”, you know
what purpose of it is. All you are doing when you are transitioning from
having something black boxed to learning it norma+lly - you are just figuring
out how it works. You already know what it does, you already know everything
required to use it, you are just understanding the internal mechanisms of it.</li>

<li>Makes learning less scary - when you understand the underlying purpose of
something it makes it a lot less scary to learn it for real, because you know
the end result already, it is just figuring out how it gets there.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I would like to believe that by doing so I am learning from my mistakes that I
made when trying to cram all the knowledge about one field in my head (machine
learning algorithms when doing the coursera course. It would have been
beneficial to know somy python so I could graph the gradient descent and play
with it, have some actual data to work with and so on.. Instead of just staring
at one algorithm).

<p>
Whether you choose to use it or not is up to you, but it can’t hurt, for sure.
It takes a really short time, like mere minutes for a single topic. It involves
information that you would eventually have to learn anyway and it also gives
you a brief but sufficient (sufficient for using it) introduction to topics,
allowing you to use them much quicker than you would be able to if you decide
to learn them all fully in sequence.
</p>

<p>
p.s. damn it takes a lot of time to write this html document in a proper way. I
sometimes miss Word document, but sometimes I don't. Vim has it's own
advantages, but I am new with it so I am a little bit slow. Learned how to
yank, paste a word or a whole line today.
